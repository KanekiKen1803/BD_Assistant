    "Call Attendees: \n",
    "Accordion: Zak\n",
    "Client: John Doe and Jane from Atlassian\n",
    "Call Summary: \n",
    "Zak opened the discussion with an overview of our company, focusing on our capabilities in large\u0002scale data integration, analytics, and reporting solutions tailored to diverse business needs. He \n",
    "emphasized our expertise in creating flexible reporting frameworks that support both leadership \n",
    "and operational insights, highlighting the potential for enhanced reporting and visualization \n",
    "through Tableau. This set the stage for a deeper discussion on the client’s needs for structured data \n",
    "and a more robust BI reporting environment.\n",
    "John raised the issue of challenges with rebate agreements, which, though not the primary focus of \n",
    "the discussion, emerged as a significant pain point. He described difficulties in managing \n",
    "contractual agreements and structuring pricing models, compounded by data being scattered \n",
    "across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization makes it challenging to \n",
    "reconcile rebate claims accurately and consistently. We shared a similar use case from another \n",
    "client, detailing how we developed automated processes to centralize and structure unstructured \n",
    "data for more reliable reconciliation.\n",
    "The conversation then moved to operational performance, where John explained the team’s focus \n",
    "on improving on-time delivery, measured through their \"file rate\" metric. He expressed that \n",
    "applying advanced analytics could help them predict and enhance these delivery metrics. We \n",
    "discussed how prescriptive AI tools could enable the team to identify potential delays before they \n",
    "impact delivery timelines, improving overall operational efficiency. John showed interest in \n",
    "exploring prescriptive analytics further, recognizing its potential to optimize delivery schedules \n",
    "and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
    "John provided a brief overview of their existing business intelligence setup, where they currently \n",
    "rely on Power BI dashboards for executive-level reporting across functions like customer service, \n",
    "supply chain, and sales. These dashboards, however, offer only high-level trends with limited drill\u0002down capabilities, which restricts teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analysis. Jane \n",
    "added that while data flows from systems like SAP and SQL into Power BI are mostly automated, \n",
    "the limitations of Power BI are apparent. The team expressed a strong need to transition to Tableau \n",
    "for both leadership and operational reporting, where they could migrate existing Power BI reports \n",
    "to Tableau to support more flexible data exploration. It was noted, however, that the client’s \n",
    "internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle this migration and to develop complex dashboards \n",
    "independently, underscoring the need for external support.\n",
    "John and Jane outlined their main data modeling challenges. The current models were developed \n",
    "for specific use cases, meaning new questions or ad-hoc analyses require additional data extracts or \n",
    "custom models. John emphasized the need for a centralized data warehouse with unified models to \n",
    "support more flexible analysis across different functions like sales and supply chain. Budget \n",
    "constraints in the past had forced them to load data directly into Power BI, limiting the ability to \n",
    "drill down to transactional levels for root-cause analysis. This situation further underscored the \n",
    "need for a robust data model to enable adaptable and in-depth reporting within Tableau.\n",
    "The team identified two main priorities for new data models: a Sales/Commercial model, which \n",
    "includes supply chain fulfillment data, and a Manufacturing/Cost model. While additional external \n",
    "commercial data (such as POS information) could be integrated later, the immediate focus will be \n",
    "on internal data sources. Key data sources for the Sales/Commercial model include SAP ECC, which \n",
    "supplies 90% of the necessary data, demand forecasts from Vanguard, and supplementary data \n",
    "from Excel files. Although some SAP data also flows into SQL databases, SQL itself is not essential \n",
    "for the initial phase of this model. Jane confirmed that master data quality is solid as it originates \n",
    "from SAP, and John noted that, while his team understands the data well, they will require \n",
    "dedicated support to ensure successful model development and Tableau migration due to a lack of a \n",
    "highly skilled internal BI team.\n",
    "The call concluded with a review of next steps. By Wednesday, we will provide a statement of work \n",
    "(SOW) detailing the design and build of an Azure-based data warehouse, development of data \n",
    "pipelines to integrate SAP ECC, Vanguard, and Excel data, and creation of a comprehensive \n",
    "Sales/Commercial data model. This new infrastructure will support the transition to Tableau, \n",
    "ensuring the reporting environment meets both leadership and operational needs. Due to the \n",
    "limited capabilities of their BI team, our support will extend to the development of initial Tableau \n",
    "dashboards after the data warehouse is established, as well as to the migration of reports from \n",
    "Power BI to Tableau. John and Jane are optimistic that these steps will enable more accessible and \n",
    "actionable insights across their organization\n",

Here’s our story: Mike and Scott, both 18, land in the same scholarship course at the University of New South Wales. 1998 Atlassian, inspired by the Greek Titan, is registered as a business name. 2001 Atlassian becomes real with the launch of Jira 1.0. 2002 Confluence 1.0 is born and released to the world. 2003 1,000 We get our 1,000th customer 2005 We co-found Pledge 1% and Atlassian Foundation is created. 2006 Our five core values come to life.

Much of the world works, often unwittingly, in a closed way. Information is hidden or lost, bonds between teams and teammates are weak, and perspectives are withheld. The result? People burn out. Knowledge is wasted. Potential is left on the table. Forward progress is halted. This is why Open matters. This is why we do what we do at Atlassian. Open work has always been central to our values. It's in the DNA of our products and we bring it to life through our practices. But it doesn't just happen. Our teams make an effort to work, communicate, and collaborate openly every day to lead by example. Open unlocks new opportunities. Open brings us together. Open unleashes potential.

      "Call Attendees: \n",
      "Accordion: Zak\n",
      "Client: John Doe and Jane from Atlassian\n",
      "Call Summary: \n",
      "Zak opened the discussion with an overview of our company, focusing on our capabilities in large\u0002scale data integration, analytics, and reporting solutions tailored to diverse business needs. He \n",
      "emphasized our expertise in creating flexible reporting frameworks that support both leadership \n",
      "and operational insights, highlighting the potential for enhanced reporting and visualization \n",
      "through Tableau. This set the stage for a deeper discussion on the client’s needs for structured data \n",
      "and a more robust BI reporting environment.\n",
      "John raised the issue of challenges with rebate agreements, which, though not the primary focus of \n",
      "the discussion, emerged as a significant pain point. He described difficulties in managing \n",
      "contractual agreements and structuring pricing models, compounded by data being scattered \n",
      "across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization makes it challenging to \n",
      "reconcile rebate claims accurately and consistently. We shared a similar use case from another \n",
      "client, detailing how we developed automated processes to centralize and structure unstructured \n",
      "data for more reliable reconciliation.\n",
      "The conversation then moved to operational performance, where John explained the team’s focus \n",
      "on improving on-time delivery, measured through their \"file rate\" metric. He expressed that \n",
      "applying advanced analytics could help them predict and enhance these delivery metrics. We \n",
      "discussed how prescriptive AI tools could enable the team to identify potential delays before they \n",
      "impact delivery timelines, improving overall operational efficiency. John showed interest in \n",
      "exploring prescriptive analytics further, recognizing its potential to optimize delivery schedules \n",
      "and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
      "John provided a brief overview of their existing business intelligence setup, where they currently \n",
      "rely on Power BI dashboards for executive-level reporting across functions like customer service, \n",
      "supply chain, and sales. These dashboards, however, offer only high-level trends with limited drill\u0002down capabilities, which restricts teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analysis. Jane \n",
      "added that while data flows from systems like SAP and SQL into Power BI are mostly automated, \n",
      "the limitations of Power BI are apparent. The team expressed a strong need to transition to Tableau \n",
      "for both leadership and operational reporting, where they could migrate existing Power BI reports \n",
      "to Tableau to support more flexible data exploration. It was noted, however, that the client’s \n",
      "internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle this migration and to develop complex dashboards \n",
      "independently, underscoring the need for external support.\n",
      "John and Jane outlined their main data modeling challenges. The current models were developed \n",
      "for specific use cases, meaning new questions or ad-hoc analyses require additional data extracts or \n",
      "custom models. John emphasized the need for a centralized data warehouse with unified models to \n",
      "support more flexible analysis across different functions like sales and supply chain. Budget \n",
      "constraints in the past had forced them to load data directly into Power BI, limiting the ability to \n",
      "drill down to transactional levels for root-cause analysis. This situation further underscored the \n",
      "need for a robust data model to enable adaptable and in-depth reporting within Tableau.\n",
      "The team identified two main priorities for new data models: a Sales/Commercial model, which \n",
      "includes supply chain fulfillment data, and a Manufacturing/Cost model. While additional external \n",
      "commercial data (such as POS information) could be integrated later, the immediate focus will be \n",
      "on internal data sources. Key data sources for the Sales/Commercial model include SAP ECC, which \n",
      "supplies 90% of the necessary data, demand forecasts from Vanguard, and supplementary data \n",
      "from Excel files. Although some SAP data also flows into SQL databases, SQL itself is not essential \n",
      "for the initial phase of this model. Jane confirmed that master data quality is solid as it originates \n",
      "from SAP, and John noted that, while his team understands the data well, they will require \n",
      "dedicated support to ensure successful model development and Tableau migration due to a lack of a \n",
      "highly skilled internal BI team.\n",
      "The call concluded with a review of next steps. By Wednesday, we will provide a statement of work \n",
      "(SOW) detailing the design and build of an Azure-based data warehouse, development of data \n",
      "pipelines to integrate SAP ECC, Vanguard, and Excel data, and creation of a comprehensive \n",
      "Sales/Commercial data model. This new infrastructure will support the transition to Tableau, \n",
      "ensuring the reporting environment meets both leadership and operational needs. Due to the \n",
      "limited capabilities of their BI team, our support will extend to the development of initial Tableau \n",
      "dashboards after the data warehouse is established, as well as to the migration of reports from \n",
      "Power BI to Tableau. John and Jane are optimistic that these steps will enable more accessible and \n",
      "actionable insights across their organization\n",

      "Client: John Doe and Jane from Atlassian\n",
      "Call Summary: \n",
      "Zak opened the discussion with an overview of our company, focusing on our capabilities in large\u0002scale data integration, analytics, and reporting solutions tailored to diverse business needs. He \n",
      "emphasized our expertise in creating flexible reporting frameworks that support both leadership \n",
      "and operational insights, highlighting the potential for enhanced reporting and visualization \n",
      "through Tableau. This set the stage for a deeper discussion on the client’s needs for structured data \n",
      "and a more robust BI reporting environment.\n",
      "John raised the issue of challenges with rebate agreements, which, though not the primary focus of \n",
      "the discussion, emerged as a significant pain point. He described difficulties in managing \n",
      "contractual agreements and structuring pricing models, compounded by data being scattered \n",
      "across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization makes it challenging to \n",
      "reconcile rebate claims accurately and consistently. We shared a similar use case from another \n",
      "client, detailing how we developed automated processes to centralize and structure unstructured \n",
      "data for more reliable reconciliation.\n",
      "The conversation then moved to operational performance, where John explained the team’s focus \n",
      "on improving on-time delivery, measured through their \"file rate\" metric. He expressed that \n",
      "applying advanced analytics could help them predict and enhance these delivery metrics. We \n",
      "discussed how prescriptive AI tools could enable the team to identify potential delays before they \n",
      "impact delivery timelines, improving overall operational efficiency. John showed interest in \n",
      "exploring prescriptive analytics further, recognizing its potential to optimize delivery schedules \n",
      "and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
      "John provided a brief overview of their existing business intelligence setup, where they currently \n",
      "rely on Power BI dashboards for executive-level reporting across functions like customer service, \n",
      "supply chain, and sales. These dashboards, however, offer only high-level trends with limited drill\u0002down capabilities, which restricts teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analysis. Jane \n",
      "added that while data flows from systems like SAP and SQL into Power BI are mostly automated, \n",
      "the limitations of Power BI are apparent. The team expressed a strong need to transition to Tableau \n",
      "for both leadership and operational reporting, where they could migrate existing Power BI reports \n",
      "to Tableau to support more flexible data exploration. It was noted, however, that the client’s \n",
      "internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle this migration and to develop complex dashboards \n",
      "independently, underscoring the need for external support.\n",
      "John and Jane outlined their main data modeling challenges. The current models were developed \n",
      "for specific use cases, meaning new questions or ad-hoc analyses require additional data extracts or \n",
      "custom models. John emphasized the need for a centralized data warehouse with unified models to \n",
      "support more flexible analysis across different functions like sales and supply chain. Budget \n",
      "constraints in the past had forced them to load data directly into Power BI, limiting the ability to \n",
      "drill down to transactional levels for root-cause analysis. This situation further underscored the \n",
      "need for a robust data model to enable adaptable and in-depth reporting within Tableau.\n",
      "The team identified two main priorities for new data models: a Sales/Commercial model, which \n",
      "includes supply chain fulfillment data, and a Manufacturing/Cost model. While additional external \n",
      "commercial data (such as POS information) could be integrated later, the immediate focus will be \n",
      "on internal data sources. Key data sources for the Sales/Commercial model include SAP ECC, which \n",
      "supplies 90% of the necessary data, demand forecasts from Vanguard, and supplementary data \n",
      "from Excel files. Although some SAP data also flows into SQL databases, SQL itself is not essential \n",
      "for the initial phase of this model. Jane confirmed that master data quality is solid as it originates \n",
      "from SAP, and John noted that, while his team understands the data well, they will require \n",
      "dedicated support to ensure successful model development and Tableau migration due to a lack of a \n",
      "highly skilled internal BI team.\n",
      "The call concluded with a review of next steps. By Wednesday, we will provide a statement of work \n",
      "(SOW) detailing the design and build of an Azure-based data warehouse, development of data \n",

      "- The client's main objectives or goals\n",
      "\n",
      "AI: ### Key Pain Points\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Challenges with Rebate Agreements:** John indicated significant difficulties in managing contractual agreements and structuring pricing models due to data being scattered across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization complicates the reconciliation of rebate claims, leading to inefficiencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Operational Performance Metrics:** The team is struggling to improve on-time delivery, as measured by their \"file rate\" metric. There is a need for advanced analytics to predict and enhance these delivery metrics, which currently impacts operational efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limitations of Existing BI Reporting Tools:** The current reliance on Power BI for executive-level reporting presents challenges. The dashboards provide high-level trends with limited drill-down capabilities, restricting teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analyses. Additionally, their internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle complex dashboard development and migration to a new platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Data Modeling Challenges:** The existing data models were tailored for specific use cases, making it difficult to perform ad-hoc analyses without additional data extracts or custom models. This situation highlights the need for a centralized data warehouse with unified models to facilitate flexible analysis across various business functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Budget Constraints:** Past budget limitations have resulted in loading data directly into Power BI, which restricts the ability to drill down for root-cause analysis and hampers the potential for in-depth reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Client's Main Objectives or Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improve Reporting and Visualization:** The client aims to transition from Power BI to Tableau to achieve more flexible data exploration and comprehensive reporting capabilities that cater to both leadership and operational needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Centralized Data Warehouse Development:** Establishing a centralized data warehouse with unified data models is a priority to support flexible analysis across different functions, particularly in Sales/Commercial and Manufacturing/Cost areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enhance Operational Performance:** By leveraging advanced analytics and prescriptive AI tools, the client seeks to improve operational performance metrics, specifically on-time delivery, to enhance overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Support for BI Team:** Due to the lack of a highly skilled internal BI team, the client requires external support for the development of new data models, the migration of reports, and the creation of initial Tableau dashboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Integration of Data Sources:** The client intends to integrate key internal data sources (SAP ECC, Vanguard forecasts, and Excel files) into the new data warehouse to build comprehensive data models that can support their analytical needs.\n",
      "Human: \n",
      "Based on the client's current situation and challenges in the transcript, identify 3 case studies that closely align with these issues. \n",

      "Call Attendees: \n",
      "Accordion: Zak\n",
      "Client: John Doe and Jane from Atlassian\n",
      "Call Summary: \n",
      "Zak opened the discussion with an overview of our company, focusing on our capabilities in large\u0002scale data integration, analytics, and reporting solutions tailored to diverse business needs. He \n",
      "emphasized our expertise in creating flexible reporting frameworks that support both leadership \n",
      "and operational insights, highlighting the potential for enhanced reporting and visualization \n",
      "through Tableau. This set the stage for a deeper discussion on the client’s needs for structured data \n",
      "and a more robust BI reporting environment.\n",
      "John raised the issue of challenges with rebate agreements, which, though not the primary focus of \n",
      "the discussion, emerged as a significant pain point. He described difficulties in managing \n",
      "contractual agreements and structuring pricing models, compounded by data being scattered \n",
      "across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization makes it challenging to \n",
      "reconcile rebate claims accurately and consistently. We shared a similar use case from another \n",
      "client, detailing how we developed automated processes to centralize and structure unstructured \n",
      "data for more reliable reconciliation.\n",
      "The conversation then moved to operational performance, where John explained the team’s focus \n",
      "on improving on-time delivery, measured through their \"file rate\" metric. He expressed that \n",
      "applying advanced analytics could help them predict and enhance these delivery metrics. We \n",
      "discussed how prescriptive AI tools could enable the team to identify potential delays before they \n",
      "impact delivery timelines, improving overall operational efficiency. John showed interest in \n",
      "exploring prescriptive analytics further, recognizing its potential to optimize delivery schedules \n",
      "and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
      "John provided a brief overview of their existing business intelligence setup, where they currently \n",
      "rely on Power BI dashboards for executive-level reporting across functions like customer service, \n",
      "supply chain, and sales. These dashboards, however, offer only high-level trends with limited drill\u0002down capabilities, which restricts teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analysis. Jane \n",
      "added that while data flows from systems like SAP and SQL into Power BI are mostly automated, \n",
      "the limitations of Power BI are apparent. The team expressed a strong need to transition to Tableau \n",
      "for both leadership and operational reporting, where they could migrate existing Power BI reports \n",
      "to Tableau to support more flexible data exploration. It was noted, however, that the client’s \n",
      "internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle this migration and to develop complex dashboards \n",
      "independently, underscoring the need for external support.\n",
      "John and Jane outlined their main data modeling challenges. The current models were developed \n",
      "for specific use cases, meaning new questions or ad-hoc analyses require additional data extracts or \n",
      "custom models. John emphasized the need for a centralized data warehouse with unified models to \n",
      "support more flexible analysis across different functions like sales and supply chain. Budget \n",
      "constraints in the past had forced them to load data directly into Power BI, limiting the ability to \n",
      "drill down to transactional levels for root-cause analysis. This situation further underscored the \n",
      "need for a robust data model to enable adaptable and in-depth reporting within Tableau.\n",
      "The team identified two main priorities for new data models: a Sales/Commercial model, which \n",
      "includes supply chain fulfillment data, and a Manufacturing/Cost model. While additional external \n",
      "commercial data (such as POS information) could be integrated later, the immediate focus will be \n",
      "on internal data sources. Key data sources for the Sales/Commercial model include SAP ECC, which \n",
      "supplies 90% of the necessary data, demand forecasts from Vanguard, and supplementary data \n",
      "from Excel files. Although some SAP data also flows into SQL databases, SQL itself is not essential \n",
      "for the initial phase of this model. Jane confirmed that master data quality is solid as it originates \n",
      "from SAP, and John noted that, while his team understands the data well, they will require \n",
      "dedicated support to ensure successful model development and Tableau migration due to a lack of a \n",
      "highly skilled internal BI team.\n",
      "The call concluded with a review of next steps. By Wednesday, we will provide a statement of work \n",
      "(SOW) detailing the design and build of an Azure-based data warehouse, development of data \n",
      "pipelines to integrate SAP ECC, Vanguard, and Excel data, and creation of a comprehensive \n",
      "Sales/Commercial data model. This new infrastructure will support the transition to Tableau, \n",
      "ensuring the reporting environment meets both leadership and operational needs. Due to the \n",
      "limited capabilities of their BI team, our support will extend to the development of initial Tableau \n",
      "dashboards after the data warehouse is established, as well as to the migration of reports from \n",
      "Power BI to Tableau. John and Jane are optimistic that these steps will enable more accessible and \n",
      "actionable insights across their organization\n",

      "\n",
      "AI: ### Key Pain Points\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Challenges with Rebate Agreements:** John indicated significant difficulties in managing contractual agreements and structuring pricing models due to data being scattered across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization complicates the reconciliation of rebate claims, leading to inefficiencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Operational Performance Metrics:** The team is struggling to improve on-time delivery, as measured by their \"file rate\" metric. There is a need for advanced analytics to predict and enhance these delivery metrics, which currently impacts operational efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limitations of Existing BI Reporting Tools:** The current reliance on Power BI for executive-level reporting presents challenges. The dashboards provide high-level trends with limited drill-down capabilities, restricting teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analyses. Additionally, their internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle complex dashboard development and migration to a new platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Data Modeling Challenges:** The existing data models were tailored for specific use cases, making it difficult to perform ad-hoc analyses without additional data extracts or custom models. This situation highlights the need for a centralized data warehouse with unified models to facilitate flexible analysis across various business functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Budget Constraints:** Past budget limitations have resulted in loading data directly into Power BI, which restricts the ability to drill down for root-cause analysis and hampers the potential for in-depth reporting.\n",

      "### Client's Main Objectives or Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improve Reporting and Visualization:** The client aims to transition from Power BI to Tableau to achieve more flexible data exploration and comprehensive reporting capabilities that cater to both leadership and operational needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Centralized Data Warehouse Development:** Establishing a centralized data warehouse with unified data models is a priority to support flexible analysis across different functions, particularly in Sales/Commercial and Manufacturing/Cost areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enhance Operational Performance:** By leveraging advanced analytics and prescriptive AI tools, the client seeks to improve operational performance metrics, specifically on-time delivery, to enhance overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Support for BI Team:** Due to the lack of a highly skilled internal BI team, the client requires external support for the development of new data models, the migration of reports, and the creation of initial Tableau dashboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Integration of Data Sources:** The client intends to integrate key internal data sources (SAP ECC, Vanguard forecasts, and Excel files) into the new data warehouse to build comprehensive data models that can support their analytical needs.\n",
      "Human: \n",
      "Based on the client's current situation and challenges in the transcript, identify 3 case studies that closely align with these issues. \n",
      "For each case study, explain how it was used to solve a similar problem in the past. \n",

      "Call Attendees: \n",
      "Accordion: Zak\n",
      "Client: John Doe and Jane from Atlassian\n",
      "Call Summary: \n",
      "Zak opened the discussion with an overview of our company, focusing on our capabilities in large\u0002scale data integration, analytics, and reporting solutions tailored to diverse business needs. He \n",
      "emphasized our expertise in creating flexible reporting frameworks that support both leadership \n",
      "and operational insights, highlighting the potential for enhanced reporting and visualization \n",
      "through Tableau. This set the stage for a deeper discussion on the client’s needs for structured data \n",
      "and a more robust BI reporting environment.\n",
      "John raised the issue of challenges with rebate agreements, which, though not the primary focus of \n",
      "the discussion, emerged as a significant pain point. He described difficulties in managing \n",
      "contractual agreements and structuring pricing models, compounded by data being scattered \n",
      "across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization makes it challenging to \n",
      "reconcile rebate claims accurately and consistently. We shared a similar use case from another \n",
      "client, detailing how we developed automated processes to centralize and structure unstructured \n",
      "data for more reliable reconciliation.\n",
      "The conversation then moved to operational performance, where John explained the team’s focus \n",
      "on improving on-time delivery, measured through their \"file rate\" metric. He expressed that \n",
      "applying advanced analytics could help them predict and enhance these delivery metrics. We \n",
      "discussed how prescriptive AI tools could enable the team to identify potential delays before they \n",
      "impact delivery timelines, improving overall operational efficiency. John showed interest in \n",
      "exploring prescriptive analytics further, recognizing its potential to optimize delivery schedules \n",
      "and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
      "John provided a brief overview of their existing business intelligence setup, where they currently \n",
      "rely on Power BI dashboards for executive-level reporting across functions like customer service, \n",
      "supply chain, and sales. These dashboards, however, offer only high-level trends with limited drill\u0002down capabilities, which restricts teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analysis. Jane \n",
      "added that while data flows from systems like SAP and SQL into Power BI are mostly automated, \n",
      "the limitations of Power BI are apparent. The team expressed a strong need to transition to Tableau \n",
      "for both leadership and operational reporting, where they could migrate existing Power BI reports \n",
      "to Tableau to support more flexible data exploration. It was noted, however, that the client’s \n",
      "internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle this migration and to develop complex dashboards \n",
      "independently, underscoring the need for external support.\n",
      "John and Jane outlined their main data modeling challenges. The current models were developed \n",
      "for specific use cases, meaning new questions or ad-hoc analyses require additional data extracts or \n",
      "custom models. John emphasized the need for a centralized data warehouse with unified models to \n",
      "support more flexible analysis across different functions like sales and supply chain. Budget \n",
      "constraints in the past had forced them to load data directly into Power BI, limiting the ability to \n",
      "drill down to transactional levels for root-cause analysis. This situation further underscored the \n",
      "need for a robust data model to enable adaptable and in-depth reporting within Tableau.\n",
      "The team identified two main priorities for new data models: a Sales/Commercial model, which \n",
      "includes supply chain fulfillment data, and a Manufacturing/Cost model. While additional external \n",
      "commercial data (such as POS information) could be integrated later, the immediate focus will be \n",
      "on internal data sources. Key data sources for the Sales/Commercial model include SAP ECC, which \n",
      "supplies 90% of the necessary data, demand forecasts from Vanguard, and supplementary data \n",
      "from Excel files. Although some SAP data also flows into SQL databases, SQL itself is not essential \n",
      "for the initial phase of this model. Jane confirmed that master data quality is solid as it originates \n",
      "from SAP, and John noted that, while his team understands the data well, they will require \n",
      "dedicated support to ensure successful model development and Tableau migration due to a lack of a \n",
      "highly skilled internal BI team.\n",
      "The call concluded with a review of next steps. By Wednesday, we will provide a statement of work \n",
      "(SOW) detailing the design and build of an Azure-based data warehouse, development of data \n",
      "pipelines to integrate SAP ECC, Vanguard, and Excel data, and creation of a comprehensive \n",
      "Sales/Commercial data model. This new infrastructure will support the transition to Tableau, \n",
      "ensuring the reporting environment meets both leadership and operational needs. Due to the \n",
      "limited capabilities of their BI team, our support will extend to the development of initial Tableau \n",
      "dashboards after the data warehouse is established, as well as to the migration of reports from \n",
      "Power BI to Tableau. John and Jane are optimistic that these steps will enable more accessible and \n",

      "Call Summary: \n",
      "Zak opened the discussion with an overview of our company, focusing on our capabilities in large\u0002scale data integration, analytics, and reporting solutions tailored to diverse business needs. He \n",
      "emphasized our expertise in creating flexible reporting frameworks that support both leadership \n",
      "and operational insights, highlighting the potential for enhanced reporting and visualization \n",
      "through Tableau. This set the stage for a deeper discussion on the client’s needs for structured data \n",
      "and a more robust BI reporting environment.\n",
      "John raised the issue of challenges with rebate agreements, which, though not the primary focus of \n",
      "the discussion, emerged as a significant pain point. He described difficulties in managing \n",
      "contractual agreements and structuring pricing models, compounded by data being scattered \n",
      "across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization makes it challenging to \n",
      "reconcile rebate claims accurately and consistently. We shared a similar use case from another \n",
      "client, detailing how we developed automated processes to centralize and structure unstructured \n",
      "data for more reliable reconciliation.\n",
      "The conversation then moved to operational performance, where John explained the team’s focus \n",
      "on improving on-time delivery, measured through their \"file rate\" metric. He expressed that \n",
      "applying advanced analytics could help them predict and enhance these delivery metrics. We \n",
      "discussed how prescriptive AI tools could enable the team to identify potential delays before they \n",
      "impact delivery timelines, improving overall operational efficiency. John showed interest in \n",
      "exploring prescriptive analytics further, recognizing its potential to optimize delivery schedules \n",
      "and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
      "John provided a brief overview of their existing business intelligence setup, where they currently \n",
      "rely on Power BI dashboards for executive-level reporting across functions like customer service, \n",
      "supply chain, and sales. These dashboards, however, offer only high-level trends with limited drill\u0002down capabilities, which restricts teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analysis. Jane \n",
      "added that while data flows from systems like SAP and SQL into Power BI are mostly automated, \n",
      "the limitations of Power BI are apparent. The team expressed a strong need to transition to Tableau \n",
      "for both leadership and operational reporting, where they could migrate existing Power BI reports \n",
      "to Tableau to support more flexible data exploration. It was noted, however, that the client’s \n",
      "internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle this migration and to develop complex dashboards \n",
      "independently, underscoring the need for external support.\n",
      "John and Jane outlined their main data modeling challenges. The current models were developed \n",
      "for specific use cases, meaning new questions or ad-hoc analyses require additional data extracts or \n",
      "custom models. John emphasized the need for a centralized data warehouse with unified models to \n",
      "support more flexible analysis across different functions like sales and supply chain. Budget \n",
      "constraints in the past had forced them to load data directly into Power BI, limiting the ability to \n",
      "drill down to transactional levels for root-cause analysis. This situation further underscored the \n",
      "need for a robust data model to enable adaptable and in-depth reporting within Tableau.\n",
      "The team identified two main priorities for new data models: a Sales/Commercial model, which \n",
      "includes supply chain fulfillment data, and a Manufacturing/Cost model. While additional external \n",
      "commercial data (such as POS information) could be integrated later, the immediate focus will be \n",
      "on internal data sources. Key data sources for the Sales/Commercial model include SAP ECC, which \n",
      "supplies 90% of the necessary data, demand forecasts from Vanguard, and supplementary data \n",
      "from Excel files. Although some SAP data also flows into SQL databases, SQL itself is not essential \n",
      "for the initial phase of this model. Jane confirmed that master data quality is solid as it originates \n",
      "from SAP, and John noted that, while his team understands the data well, they will require \n",
      "dedicated support to ensure successful model development and Tableau migration due to a lack of a \n",
      "highly skilled internal BI team.\n",
      "The call concluded with a review of next steps. By Wednesday, we will provide a statement of work \n",

      "Zak opened the discussion with an overview of our company, focusing on our capabilities in large\u0002scale data integration, analytics, and reporting solutions tailored to diverse business needs. He \n",
      "emphasized our expertise in creating flexible reporting frameworks that support both leadership \n",
      "and operational insights, highlighting the potential for enhanced reporting and visualization \n",
      "through Tableau. This set the stage for a deeper discussion on the client’s needs for structured data \n",
      "and a more robust BI reporting environment.\n",
      "John raised the issue of challenges with rebate agreements, which, though not the primary focus of \n",
      "the discussion, emerged as a significant pain point. He described difficulties in managing \n",
      "contractual agreements and structuring pricing models, compounded by data being scattered \n",
      "across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization makes it challenging to \n",
      "reconcile rebate claims accurately and consistently. We shared a similar use case from another \n",
      "client, detailing how we developed automated processes to centralize and structure unstructured \n",
      "data for more reliable reconciliation.\n",
      "The conversation then moved to operational performance, where John explained the team’s focus \n",
      "on improving on-time delivery, measured through their \"file rate\" metric. He expressed that \n",
      "applying advanced analytics could help them predict and enhance these delivery metrics. We \n",
      "discussed how prescriptive AI tools could enable the team to identify potential delays before they \n",
      "impact delivery timelines, improving overall operational efficiency. John showed interest in \n",
      "exploring prescriptive analytics further, recognizing its potential to optimize delivery schedules \n",
      "and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
      "John provided a brief overview of their existing business intelligence setup, where they currently \n",
      "rely on Power BI dashboards for executive-level reporting across functions like customer service, \n",
      "supply chain, and sales. These dashboards, however, offer only high-level trends with limited drill\u0002down capabilities, which restricts teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analysis. Jane \n",
      "added that while data flows from systems like SAP and SQL into Power BI are mostly automated, \n",
      "the limitations of Power BI are apparent. The team expressed a strong need to transition to Tableau \n",
      "for both leadership and operational reporting, where they could migrate existing Power BI reports \n",
      "to Tableau to support more flexible data exploration. It was noted, however, that the client’s \n",
      "internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle this migration and to develop complex dashboards \n",
      "independently, underscoring the need for external support.\n",
      "John and Jane outlined their main data modeling challenges. The current models were developed \n",
      "for specific use cases, meaning new questions or ad-hoc analyses require additional data extracts or \n",

      "need for a robust data model to enable adaptable and in-depth reporting within Tableau.\n",
      "The team identified two main priorities for new data models: a Sales/Commercial model, which \n",
      "includes supply chain fulfillment data, and a Manufacturing/Cost model. While additional external \n",
      "commercial data (such as POS information) could be integrated later, the immediate focus will be \n",
      "on internal data sources. Key data sources for the Sales/Commercial model include SAP ECC, which \n",
      "supplies 90% of the necessary data, demand forecasts from Vanguard, and supplementary data \n",
      "from Excel files. Although some SAP data also flows into SQL databases, SQL itself is not essential \n",

      "- The client's main objectives or goals\n",
      "\n",
      "AI: ### Key Pain Points\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Challenges with Rebate Agreements:** John indicated significant difficulties in managing contractual agreements and structuring pricing models due to data being scattered across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization complicates the reconciliation of rebate claims, leading to inefficiencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Operational Performance Metrics:** The team is struggling to improve on-time delivery, as measured by their \"file rate\" metric. There is a need for advanced analytics to predict and enhance these delivery metrics, which currently impacts operational efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limitations of Existing BI Reporting Tools:** The current reliance on Power BI for executive-level reporting presents challenges. The dashboards provide high-level trends with limited drill-down capabilities, restricting teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analyses. Additionally, their internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle complex dashboard development and migration to a new platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Data Modeling Challenges:** The existing data models were tailored for specific use cases, making it difficult to perform ad-hoc analyses without additional data extracts or custom models. This situation highlights the need for a centralized data warehouse with unified models to facilitate flexible analysis across various business functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Budget Constraints:** Past budget limitations have resulted in loading data directly into Power BI, which restricts the ability to drill down for root-cause analysis and hampers the potential for in-depth reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Client's Main Objectives or Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improve Reporting and Visualization:** The client aims to transition from Power BI to Tableau to achieve more flexible data exploration and comprehensive reporting capabilities that cater to both leadership and operational needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Centralized Data Warehouse Development:** Establishing a centralized data warehouse with unified data models is a priority to support flexible analysis across different functions, particularly in Sales/Commercial and Manufacturing/Cost areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Enhance Operational Performance:** By leveraging advanced analytics and prescriptive AI tools, the client seeks to improve operational performance metrics, specifically on-time delivery, to enhance overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Support for BI Team:** Due to the lack of a highly skilled internal BI team, the client requires external support for the development of new data models, the migration of reports, and the creation of initial Tableau dashboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Integration of Data Sources:** The client intends to integrate key internal data sources (SAP ECC, Vanguard forecasts, and Excel files) into the new data warehouse to build comprehensive data models that can support their analytical needs.\n",

      "Call Attendees: \n",
      "Accordion: Zak\n",
      "Client: John Doe and Jane from Atlassian\n",
      "Call Summary: \n",
      "Zak opened the discussion with an overview of our company, focusing on our capabilities in large\u0002scale data integration, analytics, and reporting solutions tailored to diverse business needs. He \n",
      "emphasized our expertise in creating flexible reporting frameworks that support both leadership \n",
      "and operational insights, highlighting the potential for enhanced reporting and visualization \n",
      "through Tableau. This set the stage for a deeper discussion on the client’s needs for structured data \n",
      "and a more robust BI reporting environment.\n",
      "John raised the issue of challenges with rebate agreements, which, though not the primary focus of \n",
      "the discussion, emerged as a significant pain point. He described difficulties in managing \n",
      "contractual agreements and structuring pricing models, compounded by data being scattered \n",
      "across unstructured formats, particularly in PDFs. This disorganization makes it challenging to \n",
      "reconcile rebate claims accurately and consistently. We shared a similar use case from another \n",
      "client, detailing how we developed automated processes to centralize and structure unstructured \n",
      "data for more reliable reconciliation.\n",
      "The conversation then moved to operational performance, where John explained the team’s focus \n",
      "on improving on-time delivery, measured through their \"file rate\" metric. He expressed that \n",
      "applying advanced analytics could help them predict and enhance these delivery metrics. We \n",
      "discussed how prescriptive AI tools could enable the team to identify potential delays before they \n",
      "impact delivery timelines, improving overall operational efficiency. John showed interest in \n",
      "exploring prescriptive analytics further, recognizing its potential to optimize delivery schedules \n",
      "and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
      "John provided a brief overview of their existing business intelligence setup, where they currently \n",
      "rely on Power BI dashboards for executive-level reporting across functions like customer service, \n",
      "supply chain, and sales. These dashboards, however, offer only high-level trends with limited drill\u0002down capabilities, which restricts teams from conducting detailed, transaction-level analysis. Jane \n",
      "added that while data flows from systems like SAP and SQL into Power BI are mostly automated, \n",
      "the limitations of Power BI are apparent. The team expressed a strong need to transition to Tableau \n",
      "for both leadership and operational reporting, where they could migrate existing Power BI reports \n",
      "to Tableau to support more flexible data exploration. It was noted, however, that the client’s \n",
      "internal BI team lacks the expertise to handle this migration and to develop complex dashboards \n",
      "independently, underscoring the need for external support.\n",
      "John and Jane outlined their main data modeling challenges. The current models were developed \n",
      "for specific use cases, meaning new questions or ad-hoc analyses require additional data extracts or \n",
      "custom models. John emphasized the need for a centralized data warehouse with unified models to \n",
      "support more flexible analysis across different functions like sales and supply chain. Budget \n",
      "constraints in the past had forced them to load data directly into Power BI, limiting the ability to \n",
      "drill down to transactional levels for root-cause analysis. This situation further underscored the \n",
      "need for a robust data model to enable adaptable and in-depth reporting within Tableau.\n",
      "The team identified two main priorities for new data models: a Sales/Commercial model, which \n",
      "includes supply chain fulfillment data, and a Manufacturing/Cost model. While additional external \n",
      "commercial data (such as POS information) could be integrated later, the immediate focus will be \n",
      "on internal data sources. Key data sources for the Sales/Commercial model include SAP ECC, which \n",
      "supplies 90% of the necessary data, demand forecasts from Vanguard, and supplementary data \n",
      "from Excel files. Although some SAP data also flows into SQL databases, SQL itself is not essential \n",
      "for the initial phase of this model. Jane confirmed that master data quality is solid as it originates \n",
      "from SAP, and John noted that, while his team understands the data well, they will require \n",
      "dedicated support to ensure successful model development and Tableau migration due to a lack of a \n",
      "highly skilled internal BI team.\n",
      "The call concluded with a review of next steps. By Wednesday, we will provide a statement of work \n",
      "(SOW) detailing the design and build of an Azure-based data warehouse, development of data \n",
      "pipelines to integrate SAP ECC, Vanguard, and Excel data, and creation of a comprehensive \n",
      "Sales/Commercial data model. This new infrastructure will support the transition to Tableau, \n",
      "ensuring the reporting environment meets both leadership and operational needs. Due to the \n",
      "limited capabilities of their BI team, our support will extend to the development of initial Tableau \n",
      "dashboards after the data warehouse is established, as well as to the migration of reports from \n",
      "Power BI to Tableau. John and Jane are optimistic that these steps will enable more accessible and \n",
