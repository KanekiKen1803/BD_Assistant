Overall, they needed to identify an optimal shipment strategy and understand the capacity requirements.\n▪Merilytics partnered with the client to help define the optimal fulfillment strategy based on customer SLAs and to meet the growth projections for the \nnext three years\n▪Evaluated three fulfillment scenarios to identify optimal fulfillment strategy – expanding the current warehouse, adding a second warehouse or moving \nto a larger warehouse, with their existing 3PL partner, to meet the growth projections with better customer service levels and lower fulfillment costs \n(inbound, operating & outbound)\n▪While adding a second warehouse was a more optimal option, given the operational efficiencies of a single warehouse, estimated the incremental \nfulfillment costs from the existing warehouse to get better service levels\n▪Evaluated dropshipping strategy for a few product categories and conducted a cost benefit analysis estimating the dropshipping costs to breakeven \nwith the fulfillment costs through the existing 3PL provider\n▪Across strategies, provided the capacity requirement (in sq. ft) for the next three years so that the client can plan for the same accordingly\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪Recommended warehouse option is estimated to provide ~18% savings in the shipping spend, translating to savings of $9.7M (over 3 years).\n▪Analyzed that the current dropshipping costs are higher and would have to be reduced by ~30% to break-even with the existing 3PL costs. This helped client \nstrategize their dropshipping cost reduction.\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a U.S. based bed and bath company that sells luxury bedding - organic cotton bed linens, blankets and bath towels etc.\n2\n"
