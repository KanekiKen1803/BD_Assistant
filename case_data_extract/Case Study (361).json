This reporting helped the clients in reducing their cash payouts by ~15% per quarter when compared to the bi-weekly \npayouts\n▪Breakdown comparison at a Partner Physician level helped the client to track and take decisions during the Quarterly payout's discussions with the Care \nCenter Lead or Partner Physicians that reduced their extra payouts to the Partners\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a U.S. based integrated network of gastroenterology care centers that provides services across entire spectrum of gastrointestinal issues.\n1\n"
