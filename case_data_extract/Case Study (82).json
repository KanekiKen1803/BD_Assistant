Utilized these numbers to arrive at \nConsolidated School Level and Consolidated Group Level P&L Budget, summarizing by seasonality (Summers and Non-Summer).\nUtilized the budgeted Enrollment FTEs and classroom information to arrive at an optimum classroom level FTE allocation. Optimization was built \nin Excel under operating constraints such as classroom capacity, student to teacher ratio and child-trigger ratio. FTEs derived from this algorithm \nacts as the final FTE projection to be fed into the budget template at a classroom level.\nUsed Power Query to automate the import of raw data from source files. Built macros to generate CSV files containing financial (Gross Tuition, \nLabor Expenses, Admin Expenses, etc.) and statistical (FTE, RPS, Teacher Hours, etc.) metrics to be imported to NetSuite.\nBuilt a school level and group level Assumptions tab to allow user-driven inputs as well as calculated metrics from source data, such as FTE, \nRevenue Per Student, Wage Rates, Benefits etc.. Connected the Assumptions tab to intermediate calculations such as Staffing Model (for \npayroll), Pricing Model (for revenue), etc..\n05 \nEnhanced School Level output packages by reporting financial and statistical budget metrics by months, including chart for comparison with \npast years of KPIs. Built a macro to provide a lock functionality in the file, enabling the corporate team to have control over the budget numbers.\n"
