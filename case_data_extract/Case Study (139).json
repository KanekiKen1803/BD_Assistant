Further documented the mappings for any future reporting requirements for BI team.\n•\nIdentified opportunity to automate the process of getting manual inputs from the Business team, required to run the dashboarding suite, by building custom \npython scripts from SharePoint. Transitioned the existing Power BI-based reporting suite to run-off on the new Azure-based DW. \nSituation\n•\nClient’s existing Data Warehouse was built on proprietary technology and is owned by a third-party vendor. This system does not provide the client any \ncontrol to change or improve the system and is cost-prohibitive & time-consuming. There was an opportunity to transition to Azure-based Data Warehouse\n•\nPartnered with the client to migrate the existing legacy Data Warehouse system to Azure-based Data Warehouse, through NetSuite ODBC connection, \nproviding the client complete control over the back-end infrastructure.

Performed a seamless \ntransition of the dashboarding suite without impacting the front-end business users\n•\nMigration process ensured consistent data across all the systems with extremely high-accuracy (~98%) ensuring that the dashboarding suite act as a reliable \nsource of truth for the Business/Sales team\n•\nCreated a central data repository enabling the team to further expand/add more data sources in the future and eliminated any need for manual interventions, \nfrom the Business team, i.e., automated the end-to-end reporting process\nData Warehouse Migration\n"
