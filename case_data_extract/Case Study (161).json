Data Consolidation\n▪\nConsolidate the Retail Sales ($) and Units (#) data \nof the new product (A) and the corresponding \nproduct category (B) upon which the Net Extra \neffect is to be estimated.\n▪\nPartition the Sales data into two segments i.e.,                 \n(i) Pre-launch (Bpre), and\n     (ii) Post-launch periods (Apost, Bpost)\n2. Sales Projection\n▪\nProject Sales of the product category for the post \nlaunch period (Bproj) during which the impact is to be \nestimated.\n▪\nSales can be projected based on historical \nperformance (YoY Gr%1) or the estimated growth \nduring this period.\n▪\nThe Sales can also be projected as a range of values, \nto account for margin of variation.\n4. Net Extra Calculation\n▪\nNet Extra Sales ($) resulting from the launch of new \nproduct (Anet$) is calculated by offsetting the \nestimated effect against the actuals Sales of the new \nproduct.\n•\nAnet$ = Apost + Bh/c-eff\n▪\nNet Extra% (Anet%) helps estimate the lift in revenue \nobtained due to the launch of the new product\n•\n Anet% = Anet$ / Apost\n3. Halo/Cannibalization effect\n▪\nCalculate Halo/Cannibalization effect on the \ncorresponding product category (Bh/c-eff) by \ncomparing the projected Sales against the actual \nSales during the post launch period.\n•\nBh/c-eff = Bpost - Bproj\n▪\nBh/c-eff: Positive value indicates a Halo effect, and a \nnegative value indicates a cannibalization effect\nNotes: 1. YoY Gr%:  Year-on-Year growth rate. Comparison of Sales recorded in the current year against the comparable period in the previous year. 2. Halo effect: Consumer's favoritism towards a line \nof products due to positive experiences with other products by the company. 3. Cannibalization effect: Sales loss caused by a company's introduction of a new product that displaces one of its own \nolder products. \n"
