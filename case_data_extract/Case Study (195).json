You have \nimproved 2nd order and 3rd order retention rate by 8 pps and 5 pps respectively, which could lead to a potential revenue \nuplift of ~$2.5 million through an ~7 pps uplift in reorders\nCHURN PROPENSITY MODELING\nKEY RESULT   \n•\n>90% accuracy in \nprediction\n•\n~$2.5 Mn increase in \npotential revenue\nVALUE LEVERS PULLED\n•\nChurn propensity model\n2\nYou turn to Accordion. \nWe partner with your team to deploy the predictive model to identify customers with highest probability of churn on a weekly \nbasis through an automated report to enable retention efforts on an ongoing basis. \nWe partner with you team to - \n1) Developing a customized advanced analytics model to identify customers at high risk of churn at 2nd order, 3rd order, \nand 4th order\n2) Leveraging transactional behavior along with demographic characteristics of customers to further improve the accuracy \nand effectiveness of the churn propensity model\n3) Automating the model output along with its reporting layer to adapt based on new patterns emerging from customer \nbehavior. This would drive retention efforts such as Outbound calling, email campaigns etc. on an ongoing basis based \non latest customer data\n"

Create separate models for \n2nd order churn, 3rd order churn and 3+ order churn. \nFeature engineering (Shortlisting of appropriate variables) – Correlation analysis for the above variables with customer churn to \nensure appropriate variables are selected and create combined variables to ensure appropriate features for modelling\nData Acquisition – Transformed the transactional level dataset at customer level for each order (1,2,3,3+). Utilized additional \nfactors in the analysis that could potentially impact the churn rates like Questionnaire responses (during acquisition), order \ndelay, discount etc., controlled by the company and external factors like covid cases.\nModel iteration – Iterate the model to further fine tune to enhance overall accuracy (balance between precision and recall metrics)\nModel deployment – The best performing model was deployed in Azure Databricks notebook and was scheduled to run on a \nweekly cadence using Azure Data Factory. The Databricks notebook interacts with the Azure database to extract relevant data \nand stores the results which is leveraged by the future iterations of the model as a learning. Additionally, an automated reporting \nlayer was built to provide the list of customers having high risk of churn on a weekly basis which was leveraged by the Marketing \nteam on retention initiatives.\n"
