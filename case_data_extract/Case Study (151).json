Currently, you are establishing new warehouses to accommodate the growing demand from online \nchannel and sought to optimize warehouse locations by considering factors such as transit time, shipping costs, and capacity \nconstraints. Also, you are evaluating the feasibility of fulfilling online orders for certain products from offline stores instead of \nshipping from warehouses. \nBeauty products manufacturer and retailer needs warehouse \nmodel & distribution network\n2\nYour value is enhanced. \nYou have shared the insights into the warehouse capacity utilization by months through simulating business implications of \nvarious parameters such as manpower, orders’ growth, operational cost, etc., facilitating strategic decisions regarding the \ntiming and location of new warehouses.
