Due to all these reasons, client needed to negotiate with the insurance companies to accept \nelectronic claims instead of papers. However, client lacked the visibility into paper claims data.\n▪\nMerilytics partnered with the client to build a comprehensive paper claims report and identify insurance companies (payers) with high paper claims.\n▪\nIntegrated the client’s claims & billing data with clearing house’s (Third party that send claims from care provider to insurance companies) claims data to \ncapture all billing, payment and insurance details of claims.\n▪\nPerformed data cleanup and designed a methodology to accurately count paper claims in case of resubmissions.\n▪\nBuilt a comprehensive monthly report that tracks the count of paper claims sent vs. the total count of claims; and paper claim rate by region, facility, \ninsurance type, insurance plan etc.\n▪\nIdentified the top payers (insurance companies) with high number of paper claims and those with high paper claim rate.\n▪\nThe report helped client have discussions with the insurance companies and to negotiate on the mode of claim submission. Overall, the paper claim rate \ncame down from ~19% to ~12% post these negotiations based on the report.\n▪\nIt also helped the client’s claims team in submitting the paper claims faster and improving the cash flow by identifying the insurance plans that always require \npaper claims and scheduling the claim submissions accordingly.\n"
