You have \nadopted a profit-sharing model with the acquired Practices, and they lacked visibility into their Business performance due to \ndifferent granularity of data in multiple systems and absence of single source of truth for reporting. Additionally, you were facing \nchallenges with reporting data during the migrating of acquired Practice Management Systems (PMS) to the existing core PMS \nsystems.\nOrthodontic care provider needs Enterprise data warehouse & \nBI infrastructure implementation\n2\nYour value is enhanced. \nThe integration period for incorporating practices into the reporting suite was decreased from ~6 months to ~1 month, enabling \nyou to accelerate acquisition speed by ~200%. The Management dashboard provided real-time visibility on the operational \nperformance of all practices with metrics like Patient Adds, Aligner Mix, Net Production, etc. It has saved an effort of 50-60 man-\nhours on the monthly basis.
