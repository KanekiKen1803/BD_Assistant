However, this \nresulted in longer lead times and higher safety stock\n• To address, client wanted to evaluate if there is an \nopportunity to get blank bottles from China and get the \nprinting done in US as significant share of products are \nsold in bottles\n• Printing onshore (in US) i.e., having blank bottle \ninventory onshore helps client account for any variability \nin the historical forecast error, avoiding stock-outs for a \ngiven service level\n• Analyzed the costs trade-off and identified that \ncompletely moving the printing onshore is not \neconomical due to high onshore printing costs and low \nstorage costs for finished goods\n• To address this, suggested maintaining a minimal blank \nbottle inventory onshore to avoid stock-outs for a given \nservice level. This will help reduce the buffer stock to be \nmaintained resulting in lower capex costs\nOptimal service level\nFinished Goods Inventory\nInventory Strategy\n4\n"
