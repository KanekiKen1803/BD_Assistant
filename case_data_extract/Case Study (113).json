The Data Mesh and virtualization \napproach provide a single source of truth, real-time insights, and improved decision-making capabilities, aligning your data \nstrategy with your business goals. This setup has drastically cut down on the overhead of managing centralized data and allowed \nyour teams to leverage data as an asset without the constraints of traditional data management approaches.\nDATA MANAGEMENT\nKEY RESULT   \n•\n100% automation of \ndata integration \n•\nReduced infrastructure \ncosts by 60% through \nthe adoption of Data \nVirtualization and \nData Mesh architecture\nVALUE LEVERS PULLED\n•\nData Virtualization\n•\nData Mesh\n•\nData Governance\n2\nYou turn to Accordion. \nWe partner with your team to address the complexities of integrating diverse data sources across your organization. Rather \nthan pushing towards a traditional centralized data warehouse with intricate ELT processes, we propose a Data \nVirtualization solution aligned with a Data Mesh architecture. This approach avoids the pitfalls of centralized data \nwarehousing, offering a more agile, scalable, and cost-effective data strategy tailored to your unique needs.\n1)\nWe assess your current data sources and infrastructure, identifying gaps and challenges in integrating data across your \norganization’s diverse systems.\n2) Working closely with your business teams, we design a Data Mesh architecture, emphasizing decentralized data ownership and \ngovernance empowering each business unit to take responsibility for its data ensures that the data is accurate, reliable, and \nmeaningful within its specific context.\n3) The design allows data from different systems to remain where it is while still being accessible and integrated in real-time \nthrough virtualization, ensuring data consistency and eliminating the need for heavy data movement and transformations.\nPicture this…\nYou’re looking for an optimal architecture for data and reporting to be centrally available on a real-time basis. But with data \nscattered across various acquired companies and systems—like Microsoft Dynamics GP, NPS, UKG, and Anchor—you find \nyourself facing the challenge of building a centralized data warehouse. The complexity and inconsistency due to differing \nbusiness definitions across your business units lead to fragmented and delayed reporting.\n"
