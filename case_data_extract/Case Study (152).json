You \nlacked a formal budgeting and planning framework, that resulted in inaccurate translation of growth targets into infrastructure and \npersonnel planning.\nBehavioral healthcare company needs budget modeling\n2\nYour value is enhanced. \nYou have redesigned the budget framework and helped the client in finalizing the budgets on time and enable necessary tracking \nand reporting requirements. Your budget consolidation model helped combine the budget values from more than 20 budget \nmodels without losing the details of the budget data\nBUDGET MODELING\nKEY RESULT   \n•\nDelivered P&L budget \nfor >20 regions within \n2 months timeframe\n•\n~$600M of annual \nrevenue and 4.5M \nvisits budgeted\n•\nLong range planning\n•\nBottom-up and top-down \nbudgeting\n•\nReconciliation and \ntriangulation\nVALUE LEVERS PULLED\n2\nYou turn to Accordion. \nWe partner with your team to create a formal framework for budgeting and planning process to accurately plan for \ninfrastructure and personnel, including:\n1) Finalizing the input/assumption metrics after working closely with the FP&A Team and building a top-down model to lay \nout 5 Year Budget P&L plan based on the forecasts provided by the management team\n2) Building a bottom-up budget template with the location level input metrics using macros to replicate and customize it \nfor each business unit. Also, creating separate models for planned De Novo (organic growth), acquisition (inorganic \ngrowth) locations of following FY\n3) Sharing summaries of the initial budget values with the individual business unit POCs to get their inputs. Incorporating \nthe modified inputs into the models to finalize the bottom-up budget values\n4) Designing a budget consolidation model to compile budget numbers from multiple models at location and account level. \nUploading the consolidated budget data to ERP and repurposing in other financial reports\n"
