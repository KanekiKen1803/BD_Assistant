However, there was no integration among these systems making it difficult to leverage data \nacross systems and perform targeted marketing for potential customers.\n▪\nMerilytics partnered with the client to set up an AWS Redshift DW, mirrored Zenoti DW using ETL pipelines, and set up a consent management \nsystem to integrate and reconcile consent data from multiple sources on AWS Redshift.\n▪\nBuilt a sustainable and scalable cloud-based data infrastructure on AWS Redshift to mirror the CRM databases from Zenoti as a readily available \nsingle source of truth for reporting or analysis.\n▪\nCreated data pipelines from the CRM system to the cloud DW using a serverless architecture on AWS and established an integrated consent \nmanagement and write-back system involving 3 data sources – CRM, Email Cloud (Klaviyo) and SMS cloud (Attentive).\n▪\nSegmented customers using their profile information and their interactions with the client’s yoga studios and online platform (purchases, visits etc.) \nfor targeted marketing email communication from the email marketing cloud platform.\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪\nMirroring the Zenoti DW in client’s AWS account enabled the client to have easy access to reliable and reconciled data for quick reporting purposes. \nThis new AWS Datawarehouse supported by serverless architecture helped client in significant cost reductions in maintaining the DW and a significant \nreduction in payments (~8K USD per month) to vendor for the analytics platform built on the vendor DW.\n▪\nIntegrated consent management process ensured that the consent data that came through different point of entries are centrally managed and \nwritten-back to relevant systems based on reconciled consent status.\n▪\nSetup built to enable daily processing of CRM/POS data on a serverless architecture provided inputs to the email marketing cloud for customer \nsegmentation.\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a yoga fitness chain in the U.S. with around 200 locations across the country, and presence in Live and On-demand platforms.\n2\nDW IMPLEMENTATION & CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INTEGRATION FOR \nA YOGA FITNESS CHAIN\n"
