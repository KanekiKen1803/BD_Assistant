Using the funnel model, estimated the overall conversion rate for the mobile app.\n▪\nBuilt a user driven model with flexibility to adjust conversion for each page in the mobile app.\n▪\nEstimated the ROI for three different scenarios – Base, Optimistic and Pessimistic – by changing LTV (Lifetime Value) and conversion rate. The base \nscenario was with a marginal improvement in LTV and retention due to better engagement through the app. The pessimistic case assumed with no \nimprovement and the optimistic case assumed with significant improvement in DTC (Direct to customer) business.\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪\nForecasting model determined that the mobile app is expected to improve the conversion rate and LTV and bring in more people through a referral \nprogram\n▪\nThe mobile app would bring in $35.5M (71%) additional revenue and $14.1M (71%) additional EBITDA. The mobile app program is expected to bring \nin 190k (40%) more customers in the upcoming year predominantly through the referral program and generate higher conversions\n▪\nThe increased revenue and EBITDA forecasted by the model drove the client to launch the mobile app.\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a producer of collagen-based health supplements and is the category leader in the U.S. \n2\n"
