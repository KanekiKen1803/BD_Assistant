With businesses \nacross several countries, the client wanted consistency in reporting of actual and forecasted cash flows\n▪Merilytics partnered with the client to build a Cash flow model by restructuring and organizing the reporting across its entities. Also, created Excel \ndashboards that can be refreshed weekly to report and track actuals and forecast the cash flows across the company\n▪\nThe cash flow model provides a 78-week weekly and monthly cash outlook for each individual entity as well as a consolidated view for the entire \ncompany\n▪\nCreated bank activity helper files which consolidates actual bank transactions from multiple banks for each entity and provides output of actuals in the \nrequired format by automatically mapping all the bank transactions to the line items in the cash flow (by using keywords and descriptions)\n▪\nDeveloped a mechanism to track and compare Actuals vs. Forecast and Forecast vs. Forecast for different periods\n▪\nPrepared a model to analyze forecast accuracy by identifying consistently under or over forecasted line items which would help the client to improve \nthe accuracy of the forecasts by changing the methodology/forecast assumptions if needed\n▪\nModelled an analysis of Intercompany flow variance to reconcile intercompany outflows and inflows\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪The Cash Flow model helped the client to closely track and assess the cash position of its different entities which in turn helped them in managing their \nshort-term liquidity planning\n▪The standardized reporting in the model enhanced the ability of the client to identify inaccuracies in reporting and providing valuable insights to improve \nthe future forecasts over a period of time. \n▪The model improved reporting consistency which reduced intercompany flow variance by ~ $ 6 M. It is also estimated that the model reduced time and \neffort required for consolidation by ~50-60%\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nA global medical device company that develops, manufactures, and sells orthopedic implant equipment and related surgical instruments for joint replacement\n1\n"
