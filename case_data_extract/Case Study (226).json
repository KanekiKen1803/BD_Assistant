        "content": "© 2023 Accordion / CONFIDENTIAL\nSITUATION\n▪Client lacked visibility into the company’s terminal (service centers) operations performance due to lack of structured timely reporting and legacy data systems. This made it \nvery difficult to identify poorly performing terminals and to incentivize better performing terminals.\n▪Merilytics partnered with the client to build a TV dashboard with a leaderboard of terminals based on key operations performance metrics\n▪Identified the key operations metrics (such as Dimming%, Reweigh%, Margin%, Utilization, Service%, Scanning Compliance%, Cost Per Mile (CPM), P&D (Pickup & Delivery) \nCost/Shipment, etc.) and their data sources. Finalized goals for each of the metrics for all terminals based on historical performance. \n▪Connected all data sources into a robust data warehouse and built a tabular data model on SSAS with all the KPIs defined\n▪Built a dashboard on Power BI with a leaderboard for terminals (ranking is based on number of goals hit; and in case of tie, %goal attainment score is considered) to track their \nperformance on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. \n▪Integrated this Power BI dashboard with ScreenCloud application and created different screens for each terminal (using a dynamic filter based on terminal name) that refresh \nevery 10 minutes. Setup TV screens across offices of all terminals taking the live feed from ScreenCloud application. \nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪The TV Dashboard helped client reward the top 3 terminals every month with incentives and identify the terminals with poor performance to take necessary actions. Gamification \nthrough this league increased competition among the terminals leading to an overall performance improvement.\n▪Within 3 months after the launch of TV dashboard – \nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is an LTL (Less-than-Truckload) shipping services company based in the U.S. serving lanes across ~30 major cities in the country.\nOperations TV Dashboard for an LTL Logistics Company  \n1\n─Shipment Dimming (Measuring Dimensions) compliance increased by ~20% \n(from ~73% to ~93%); equivalent to ~$100K/month savings from Dimming \nerrors\n─Reweigh compliance increased by ~3% (from ~95% to 98%); equivalent to \n~$30K/month savings from Weighing errors \n"
