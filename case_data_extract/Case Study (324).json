The design also included a screener section to select appropriate respondents for the survey. \n▪\nWorked with a third-party research company and provided them with a complete set of coding rules for implementing the survey\n▪\nAnalyzed the survey results using logistic regression to estimate self and cross price elasticity of client and competitor products\n▪\nThe client leveraged the insights from the conjoint survey to make pricing decisions for the new product\n▪\nThe analysis provided visibility for the client into customer preferences for various brands and helped fine tune the forecast for the new product\n"
