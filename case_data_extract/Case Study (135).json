Merilytics \ncreated a unique identifier using different combinations of data fields (e.g., Bill # assigned using file number, assigned using payment date & \namount, etc.)  to map the transactions amounting to additional 86% of total claimed amount\n▪\nIdentified list of overbilled transactions/bills at each facility that could be claimed by the client for reimbursement. \n▪\nCreated Excel & Power BI dashboards to facilitate reconciliation at multiple levels (district/facility/patient/transaction) that could be refreshed  \non a monthly basis\nVALUE ADDITION\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a healthcare services company that operates long-term acute-care hospitals and provides rehabilitation services across the United States\nIMPACT\n▪\nIdentified 5% of total claimed amount as net overbillings for transactions over a period of 18 months, leading to a potential reimbursement of \n8% of the total fee from third-party collections\n2\n"
