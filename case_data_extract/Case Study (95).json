It also included a screener section to ensure that the \nsurvey is administered on the appropriate respondent base \n▪\nPartnered with a third-party research company to administer the survey and provided them a complete set of coding rules for the UI\nVALUE ADDITION\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nDummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of dummy text is nonsensical. Due to its \nwidespread use as filler text for layouts, non-readability is of great importance\nSITUATION\n▪\nAn innovative hospitality client wanted to devise a comprehensive pricing strategy for its next phase of expansion that enables it to penetrate new \nmarkets while continuing to be positioned as a “wellness” brand \n▪\nOpportunity to explore a flat pricing option vs. the traditional industry’s model of variable pricing through out the week and year\n▪\nNeed to also identify the service attributes that could be bundled with the base prices vs. those that should be unbundled and charged separately \nIMPACT\n▪\nClient leveraged the insights from the survey to devise the pricing strategy and the final pricing menu was aligned with the recommendations from the \nanalysis\n▪\nThe analysis provided visibility for the client into the customer preferences for various service attributes. This was leveraged to devise appropriate \nmarketing communications and promotions initiatives.\n2\n"
