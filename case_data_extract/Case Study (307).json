The credit applications were \nthen approved based on the classification by the newly deployed model.\n▪\nIdentified key features of the classification model and monitored their population stability to trigger retraining of the model, by comparing the \napplication pool against the validation set over time.\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪\nThe credit model built by Merilytics helped the client reduce the charge-off rate of their asset pool (by 6% on a tranche level average) and \nunderwrite contracts within their risk appetite\n▪\nHelped the client to reduce the delinquency rate (by 9% on a tranche level average), improve the terminal cash flow and maintain borrowing \nbalance in line with the company’s annual targets\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a financial services company that provides point-of-sale financing to consumers making purchases at stores across the United States\n2\n"
