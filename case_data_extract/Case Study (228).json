These data-driven initiatives \nhelped the client become profitable within I \nyear of the engagement.\n▪As a result, Gross Margins increased by $20 \nmillion (5% margin improvement). \nOUTPUTS\nABOUT THE CLIENT: Client is an LTL (Less-than-Truckload) shipping services company serving lanes across ~30 major cities.\n"
