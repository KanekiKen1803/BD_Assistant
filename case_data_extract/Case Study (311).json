The current \nprocess was limited to an aggregated level without differentiation by channel and without visibility into past performance and variance vs. plans.\n▪Merilytics partnered with the client to streamline the OTB process and enabled planning at a channel level as well as provided visibility into variance \nvs. forecast and original plan. This was enabled through a custom built OTB Application that had automated connection to actuals and prior plans.\n▪Enabled the planners to plan at a channel level and compare the forecast plans against actuals, last forecast and original plan to improve future \nbudgeting/planning.\n▪Provided visibility into purchase plans at different levels (such as channel, department, overall) and identify drivers of variance\n▪Enabled the Planning head to track the entire process real time with flexibility to view all previous forecast at one place and consolidate through the tool\n▪Integrated the OTB tool with the Enterprise Data Warehouse to update actuals on the OTB tool at weekly cadence and store the forecasted plans in the \nData Warehouse for future plans/forecasts.\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪Streamlined and automated process of monthly planning provided detailed visibility into the budget forecasting required to support Open to Buy process\n▪Reduced the turnaround time to forecast and upload plans by ~70% and removed manual consolidation of plans\n▪Automated process of storing and updating data with validation of the same enhanced the data consistency and integrity which enhances scalability\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a leading omni-channel boating and fishing retailer in the U.S serving B2C and B2B customers\n2\n"
