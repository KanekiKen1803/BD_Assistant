Developed a comprehensive questionnaire for these discussions \nto capture details such as server information, data flow, replication process, data size, frequency of ingestion etc.\n▪Documented the data flow of all systems, servers and applications; and created data flow diagram for the current architecture\n▪Assessed the current architecture to identify the opportunities and gaps for enhancements \n▪Recommended an alternate on-premises architecture to improve efficiency, scalability, automation of processes in existing architecture and integration of Ops systems \n▪Recommended a cloud-based data architecture along with a plan to transition from on-premises to cloud environment\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪Based on the recommendations, client was able to bridge the gaps in current architecture and integrate all data sources into a consolidated server, which further helped in \ncreating an efficient automated BI reporting suite\n▪The proposed architecture also helped client to establish transparent data flows and strong data governance\n▪Client also planned a long-term transition from on-premises to cloud-based data environment based on the recommendations\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient provides LTL (Less-Than-Truckload) shipping services to businesses across all major metro cities in the U.S. \nData Architecture Assessment For A Logistics Company\n2\n"
