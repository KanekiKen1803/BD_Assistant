This impacted \nthe turnaround time to evaluate opportunities during the diligence phase.\n•\nPartnered with the client to automate the processes, that significantly reduced the turnaround for the evaluation of historical royalties of record labels that \nwere being considered for acquisition. Additionally, provided visibility into the holistic performance of the existing catalogs and helped evaluate potential \nopportunities for acquiring new music catalogs.\nRoyalty payments analytics for an independent record label \nand music publisher\n2\nImpact\n•\nCustom consolidator resulted in ~80% reduction in FTE-hours required to consolidate royalty statements and extract streaming consumption data from APIs.\n•\n~50% more likely to identify and act upon potential artists / songs, due to a faster turnaround time.\n•\n~10% improvement in portfolio performance due to better artist / song selection based on historical statement and current streaming consumption trends.\nROYALTY PAYMENTS AND \nCONSUMPTION ANALYTICS\n"
