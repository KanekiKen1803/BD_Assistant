Due to high-growth period driven by acquisitions, the current \ninventory management process is resulting in ~$230M+ of working capital tied in inventory.\nFood contract manufacturer needs to re-stock its working \ncapital\n2\nYour value is enhanced. \nYou have Identified opportunity to reduce inventory by $20M through order cycle optimization by defining the key target and \nfocus areas. You have implemented the optimized process for 400+ pilot SKUs to drive a $12M run-rate opportunity and provided \nroadmap to realize the ~$20M opportunity.
