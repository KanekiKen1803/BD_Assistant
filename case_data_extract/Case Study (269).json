Determined the overlap time spent by each server assistant \nsupporting the server. Calculated ‘Per Minute Tip Share Contribution’ based on the total time spent by the server\n•\nCalculated the total tip share amount for each server assistant using the per-minute tip share and the time spent by the server assistant\n•\nAny remaining tip amount (after sharing with server assistants) is awarded to the server\n•\nDeployed this automated tip allocation model in the SQL server and integrated it with the client’s payroll system\nSituation\n•\nAll the assistants to servers in client’s restaurants get a share of the total daily tips from the customers based on a legacy tip allocation process. This \nallocation process was not equitable and was subject to exploitation by the assistants as it didn’t account for the time spent by the assistants. For example, \nassistants who supported for just 1 minute used to get the same tip share as the ones who supported an hour with the server.\n•\nPartnered with the client to build a robust tip allocation model that accounts for the time spent by the server assistants\nTip Allocation Model for a Restaurant Chain\n2\nImpact\n•\nThe new tip allocation model helped the client reduce the discrepancies related to over-payment and under-payment of tips and ensured a fair share of tip \namounts to all servers and server assistants\n•\nThe model helped in ~39% better allocation of tips to servers (where the change is more than $1 per hour) with ~$200K redistributed tip amount (per quarter)\nServer Tip Allocation Model\n"
