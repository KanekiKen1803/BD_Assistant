Direct \naccess was not available to RCM and EMR data, and team relied on Enterprise Business Optimizer (EBO) or front-end reports provided by ERP systems\n▪Merilytics partnered with the client to build robust and scalable Datawarehouse by integrating EMR/RCM data from eCW, Lab data from OrchardSoft \nHarvest and Payroll data from Paycom/Dayforce. This data infrastructure was leveraged to build out operations and RCM dashboards on Power BI\n▪Analyzed both on-premises and Cloud based eCW data sources and developed end-to-end BI infrastructure for supporting multiple verticals and providing \ncentralized reporting solution\n▪Developed more than 180+ secure data processing pipelines on Azure Synapse for daily data capture. Created custom-coded ETL process for handling \nTransaction log shipping process for cloud hosted eCW integration using Azure VM\n▪Created user friendly data models for custom report building and created single source of truth in the form of facts and dimension tables across functions\n▪Developed Power BI Dashboards for RCM and Operations functions along with an executive dashboard encompassing critical KPIs across the company\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a U.S.-based leading specialty women’s health physician group offering patient care in obstetrics and gynecology\n3\n▪Significantly reduced manual and time-consuming data management processes by creating central repository that provides clean, sanitized, and \ntransformed data. Also, data integration from new verticals or regions became seamless.\n▪Reduction in time lag (from 2 days to 1 day) for data availability from eCW which further helped the business team to work with the latest data\n▪Provided better visibility into the business performance by creating advanced consolidated dashboards and provided flexibility to stakeholders to extract \nessential data as per requirements from a central data repository\n"
