The flat “30% discount rate” strategy was not \nincreasing the retention rate and was decreasing the purchase margins.\n▪Merilytics partnered with client’s CRM team to design a discounting strategy that provides discounts on customer’s next purchase to targeted customers based \non their historical purchase characteristics such as churn probability, LTV, and type of customer. \n▪Merilytics also created a Customer 360 profile using the survey responses given by the customers in each platform and created an NPS dashboard\n▪Calculated churn probability for each customer, based on machine learning algorithm (randomforestclassifier) using LTV (Lifetime value), recency of order, \nfrequency of order, tenure of customer, discount, and subscription order as inputs\n▪Segmented customers based on Type, Churn score, and LTV into 27 segments; Subscriber-High Churn-High LTV being the highest priority segment and Try & \nBounce-Low Churn-Low LTV being the lowest priority segment. Personalized discount rates are assigned between 5-30% that are updated daily for each customer \nbased on their segmentation\n▪Consolidated the customer survey responses in a consumable format and stored in the data warehouse. Created a pipeline between the data warehouse and \nCRM tool to pass the customer survey responses in the form of ratings over the CRM tool.\n▪Calculated the Net Promoter Score (NPS) for each customer based on the ratings given on Bazaarvoice, Survey Monkey, and site pop-ups and built a dashboard \nthat shows the overall Brand NPS across all survey sources and an overall Product NPS score.\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪Revised discount strategy improved client margins because now they don’t have to give “Flat 30%” discount to all customers\n▪Personalized discount rates helped the CRM team to customize their customer win back funnel emails and share the discount rates as per the customer’s \npurchasing behavior. Increased sales margin (~2.5M USD per quarter) by providing optimum discounts and not flat rates\n▪NPS Dashboard enabled the client team to take strategic decisions such as streamlining the product line-up by identifying low rated products and removing them \nfrom listing\n2\n"
