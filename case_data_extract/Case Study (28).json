However, your monthly \nclose process is cumbersome, labor-intensive, and prone to discrepancies due to manual errors and non-standardized \nprocedures, as it requires manually downloading transaction data for each practice and building a model to recognize \nrevenue for the given month\nHealthcare provider company needs a “accurate view” into the \nRevenue Recognition\n2\nYour value is enhanced. \nYou have eliminated the 36 man-hours of manual effort per facility each month and significantly enhanced the accuracy of \nthe Revenue Recognition process through complete end-to-end automation. Additionally, the solution enables near real-\ntime monitoring and tracking through an integrated reporting layer, providing greater transparency and control over \nfinancial operations\nHEALTHCARE \nKEY RESULT   \n•\nAutomation of the \nRevenue Recognition \nand improved accuracy\n•\nEliminated 36 man-\nhours of effort per \nfacility each month\nVALUE LEVERS PULLED\n•\nRevenue Recognition \nAutomation\n•\nPayer Collection Rate\n2\nYou turn to Accordion. \nWe collaborate with your team to design and implement a scalable, automated Revenue Recognition model that seamlessly \ncalculates revenue to be recorded in the Income Statements, streamlining your financial close process and minimizing \nmanual intervention\n1) Develop a robust, scalable, and automated data model for the Revenue Recognition process across all practices, \nensuring consistency and efficiency while accommodating the complexities of multi-practice financial reporting\n2) Utilize historical payer payment patterns to forecast collectable amounts across practices, clinics, service types, and \nProcedure Codes (CPT), enabling data-driven insights into payer behavior and more accurate revenue forecasting\n3) Customize the model to capture transaction snapshots and calculations on a specified day each month (e.g., the 10th), \nand build a comprehensive reporting layer that provides actionable revenue metrics that can be directly incorporated \ninto the Income Statements\n"
