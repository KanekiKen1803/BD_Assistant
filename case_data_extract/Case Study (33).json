Additionally, a detailed case study was carried out in one of the markets where \nthe company has high number of locations, to understand network effect on the overall business\nSituation\n•\nCompany was planning to expand its business by setting up a large number of new locations across the U.S.\n•\nCompany wanted to gauge the impact of cannibalization/network effect on the overall business, triggered by the opening of new locations\n•\nPartnered with the company to build a comprehensive model to estimate cannibalization impact observed on the locations in the past when a new location \nwas opened within the trade areas of existing locations\nCannibalization analysis for a fitness chain\n2\nImpact\n•\nProvided visibility into the timeframe it takes for the cannibalization impact to subside and for the location to regain its organic growth\n•\nIdentified markets with scope for opening new locations that helped the client to build strategy for upcoming locations\nIMPACT OF CANNIBALIZATION FROM \nNEW LOCATION\n"
