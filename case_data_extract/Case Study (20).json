However, the were unable to identify the drivers for \nvariance in cost vs. annual operations plan and YTD benchmarks. \n▪\nMerilytics partnered with the client to identify the cost drivers and quantify their impact on profitability\n▪\nChanges in total volume produced, manufacturing cost of SKUs and the relative volume/mix of SKUs produced were identified as the key drivers \nimpacting production cost and the overall profits.\n▪\nThe variance in actual cost vs. the base (annual plan/YTD trend) was attributed to each driver by calculating expected cost for the evaluation \nperiod, assuming no changes were made to the other identified cost drivers.\n▪\nThe analysis was built to quantify the impact of each cost driver at a SKU, sub-category, category, Plant and region level\n▪\nImpact of cost driver was provided for each of the cost accounts captured in the monthly P&L. This ensured variable, fixed and sunk costs were \ntreated differently and a precise impact of the drivers on each account was calculated. \nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪\nOur analysis enabled the client to identify situations where an increase in cost was in line with the expectation and a decrease in cost might not have \nbeen beneficial.\n▪\nThe analysis helped the client to track operational efficiency at different levels, by isolating the impact of changes on manufacturing cost.\n▪\nOur analysis also quantified the impact of changes in sales plan on profitability. This helped the client identify new pricing and marketing \nopportunities.  \nABOUT THE CLIENT\nThe client is an American dairy company with over a $1 Billion in annual revenue\n2\n"
