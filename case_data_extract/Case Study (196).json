Multiple iteration of these models were run with various combination of input \nvariables and selected Fb-Prophet and Neural-Prophet methods as the final models had the lowest MAPE (mean absolute \npercentage error) \nFeature engineering (Shortlisting of appropriate variables) – Correlate the above variables with customer churn to ensure \nappropriate variables are selected and create combined variables to ensure appropriate features for modelling. dataset was cleaned \nfrom extreme outliers occurring due to promotional campaigns that could not be quantified\nData Acquisition – Transformed the transactional level dataset to weekly acquisition cohort level with period wise retention \nrates. Utilized additional factors in the analysis that could potentially impact the retention rates like marketing spend, discount \netc., controlled by the company and external factors like covid cases, federal interest rates etc.\nModel iteration – Most recent data is withheld from training and used to evaluate models, and their parameters based on the \nforecast accuracy. MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) is used for evaluation the model with the lowest MAPE is selected.\nModel deployment – Deployed all the required bash code in Azure Databricks notebook and scheduled the code to run on a \nweekly cadence using Azure Data Factory. The Databricks notebook interacts with the database to extract data and store the \nresults in a DWH table.\n"
