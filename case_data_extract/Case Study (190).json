Eg: Physician schedule \nunavailability for certain clinics\n▪Client was able to set process and compliance benchmarks for regions resulting from the homogenization of the regional patient service and internal \nprocesses\n▪Clinic teams were able to improve utilization rate by addressing No-Show repeat offenders and addressing optimization opportunities in the \nappointments schedule\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a pediatric healthcare provider with presence in U.S.\nVALUE ADDITION\n▪Setup automated data ingestion from the data sources (eCW, TriMed, & Mapping files) using Azure Data Factory and Pipelines as the Data Integration \ntechnology\n▪Developed analytics models for the identified KPIs. Performed in-depth data & dashboards functionality validation and provided visibility into different \nappointment statuses, along with the ability to view trends across key appointments indicators at an Enterprise level, and to view the numbers by \nvarious dimensions (EHR system, Visit Type, Region, Departments, etc.)\n2\n"
