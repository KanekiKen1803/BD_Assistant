Discussed with key \nstakeholders from Finance team and identified list of new items which need to be populated in NetSuite\n•\nCreated final data schema in the form of ready to upload tables with the cleansed data populated for direct migration into NetSuite\nSituation\n•\nInvoicing process is executed outside of QuickBooks (Accounting System) due to lack of integration with other systems. Invoices are summarized prior to \nbeing uploaded into QuickBooks and granular level data is omitted in the invoice\n•\nGranular details and exhaustive list of Customers, Suppliers and Services are not available, leading to challenges in migrating to new accounting system \n(NetSuite)\n•\nPartnered with client to explore, map, cleanse, consolidate and migrate the Customers, Suppliers and Services data from QuickBooks to NetSuite \nData mapping and cleansing – NetSuite implementation for PE-\nowned BGV software firm\n2\nImpact\n•\nComparative analysis helped team identify key gaps in older systems and addressed them during the cleansing and mapping process\n•\nConsolidation of data across systems helped reduce time required for creating an exhaustive list of Customers, Suppliers and Services/Items\n•\nCreated data schema and populated the standardized data after validation, which served as ready to migrate solution for client and simplified the migration \nprocess. \n•\nAchieved the results in 30 days and hence helped the Accounting team to migrate their systems without affecting regular operations\nData Mapping and Cleansing – \nQuickbooks to Netsuite \nImplementation\n"
