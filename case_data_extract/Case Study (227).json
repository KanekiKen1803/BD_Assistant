Client was looking \nto provide repeatable and predictable schedules to \ntheir in-house drivers to ensure good experience \nand high retention.\n▪Merilytics partnered with the client to build a route \ncreation and assignment model to assign drivers \nwith repeatable routes based on the monthly \ndemand of the company and the driver \npreferences.\nINPUTS\n▪Identified the drivers needed per week between \neach set of terminals based on the demand \nbetween terminals and allowed hub-and-spoke \nrouting.\n▪Created repeatable daily, weekly, fortnightly out-\nand-back (A-B-A) as well as triangular itineraries \n(A-B-C-A) based on the length and frequency of \neach trip, following all the driving regulations set by \nFMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration).\n▪Mapped the itineraries to the drivers with \nweightages based on distance from the preferred \nterminal/region as well as driver tenure and \nhistorical routes they have travelled.\n▪Created 200+ repeatable itineraries from which \ndrives can select from and provided a prioritized \nlist of driver options for each itinerary based on the \nscores generated by the weightage.\nPROCESSING\n▪Itineraries created by the model helped client \nprovide their drivers with repeatable schedule \noptions and thus improved their driver retention \nrate.\n▪The predictable schedule helped the client plan for \nad-hoc demand efficiently that should be catered \nby external power and thus reducing peak demand \ncosts incurred for this external power (third parties \nproviding trucks and drivers).\nOUTPUTS\nABOUT THE CLIENT: Client is a B2B Less than Truck Load (LTL) logistics company providing transportation services across all major metro cities in the U.S.\n"

Driver drives for \n10-11 hrs/day at 50 mi/hr speed.\n• A driver needs a 34 hr rest before starting the next trip.\nFor each of pairs identified, created itinerary by selecting right match of \ndispatches from A-B and B-A, starting from terminal with less dispatches.\nIf A-B has 2 dispatches/week (Tue, Fri) and B-A has 5/week (1 each, Mon– \nFri), identify corresponding trips for B-A, for each of the 2 A-B trips\nIf the truck dispatched from A on Tuesday reaches B by \n• Thursday before noon, pick up Wednesday load from B (i.e., if load needs \nto wait for <12 hours)\n• Thursday post noon, pick up Thursday load from B (i.e., next available load)\nRevalidated the itineraries and shortlist the ones that fall under the criteria \ndefined in Selection. Additionally, validated that the trips are strictly within the \ndesignated duration i.e., returning to terminal before the end of 24 hrs, 7 days \nor 14 days accordingly.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n"
