Hence, the purchase orders generated from the system \nwere not optimal, leading to frequent stock outs and low service levels\n▪\nMerilytics  partnered with the company to develop a supply planning model by evaluating the manufacturing processes, accounting for production \ncapacity and bottlenecks, and recommend the production/supply schedule to meet future demand with greater accuracy.\n▪\nAnalyzed in-house manufacturing processes (grinding, bagging and extrusion) and identified production bottlenecks to estimate required production \nhours and plan production at manufacturers effectively\n▪\nEstimated optimum order quantity to meet forecasted demand taking into account minimum order quantity (MOQ) constraints, vendor delivery lead \ntimes, safety stock inputs and plant efficiencies\n▪\nProvided flexibility to overlay production and order quantity by week based on in-house and vendor capacity constraints and inventory levels\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪Our comprehensive Supply model positively impacted their supply planning performance in allowing the planner to factor in the constraints during the \nplanning process and identifying key drivers of variation in inventory and production, to generate POs for optimum inventory and service levels\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nCompany is a PE-owned pet food manufacturer based in the U.S.\n2\n"
