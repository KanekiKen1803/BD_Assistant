The dataset structure and sources for these three entities varied \nwidely. Therefore, we decided to analyze each Entity group separately. \n•\nAs a first step in identifying potential revenue leakage, we wanted to ensure that all subscriptions are being \ninvoiced accurately. We then compared Subscriptions/Bookings data with Invoices data at each customer \nlevel to identify revenue leakage.\n•\nNext step was to ascertain that the price updates in the contracts were implemented appropriately. Since, \nthe pricing terms data available in the subscription dataset was not reliable, we examined the digital copies \nof Contracts to get correct pricing terms. We then checked if these terms were implemented as mentioned, \nat the time of renewals.\n•\nFinally, we leveraged product usage data to look for potential revenue leakage. While assessing product \nusage date we worked on two approaches \n•\nRevenue Upside – Cases where the usage metric (example- no. of licenses) exceeded the subscribed limit\n•\nActive Customer Check – Cases where the customer has churned but we observed evidence of software \nafter switch-off date.\nRevenue Upside\nActive Customers with Overutilization\n•\nWe aligned with client to focus on evaluating the data for Dec 2023 to achieve the true Closing ARR for FY23.\n•\nTo evaluate the existing ARR model, we calculated the ARR opening balance and closing balance at a \ncustomer level and compared it with the output from ARR model. Identified gaps after comparison were \nhighlighted.\n•\nWhile bridging the recognized revenue to reported ARR, we compared the data at customer and entity. \nMethodology/Approach\n"
