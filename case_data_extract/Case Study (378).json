Developed a comprehensive \nquestionnaire for these discussions to capture details such as server information, data flow, replication process, data size, frequency of ingestion, etc.\n▪Documented the data flow of all systems, servers, and applications; and created a data flow diagram for the current architecture\n▪Assessed the current architecture to identify the opportunities and gaps for enhancements \n▪Recommended an alternate on-premises architecture to improve efficiency, scalability, automation of processes in existing architecture and integration \nof Ops systems \n▪Recommended a cloud-based data architecture option along with a plan to transition from on-premises to cloud environment \nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪Based on the recommendations, client was able to bridge the gaps in the current architecture and integrate all data sources into a consolidated server, \nwhich further helped in creating an efficient automated BI reporting suite\n▪The proposed architecture also helped client to establish transparent data flows and strong data governance\n▪Client also planned a long-term transition from on-premises to cloud-based data environment based on the recommendations\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient provides LTL (Less-Than-Truckload) shipping services to businesses across all major metro cities in the U.S. \n1\n"
