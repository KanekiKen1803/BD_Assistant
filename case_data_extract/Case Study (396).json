The client was additionally able \nto recover over $250k due to this activity as old and missing credit memos were recovered from vendors and applied against vendor accounts.\n•\nPayment prioritization and AP mailbox management ensured that critical vendors are paid on time. This made sure that the client was not put under “credit \nholds” by their vendors and therefore lowering the risk of operations getting delayed\n•\nAccurate general ledger account coding resulted in reduction in expense reclassification after period close from $200k to $10k per month\nAccounts payable solutions \n"
