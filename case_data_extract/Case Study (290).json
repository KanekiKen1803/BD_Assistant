However, client shifted the ERP \nsystem from NetSuite to SAP, therefore was looking to perform a diagnostic study to receive potential cost-effective solutions needed to archive all the \nNetSuite data so that it can be restored or referenced in future for reporting/auditing purposes\n•\nPartnered with key stakeholders and conducted workshops with business functional areas owners of various departments to understand the data \nrequirements from NetSuite and recommended data archival plan to archive the NetSuite data post cut-off date\nDiagnostic study of NetSuite data archival plan for health \nsupplements provider\n2\nImpact\n•\nClient accepted and approved the plan for NetSuite data archiving in Azure environment along with associated cost and implementation timelines\n•\nFrom diagnostic phase, client got the archival plan ahead of time which helped them to decide the cut off date for NetSuite data system and to confidently \nswitch over to SAP without loss of historical data\nDIAGNOSTIC OF NETSUITE DATA \nARCHIVAL PLAN\n"
