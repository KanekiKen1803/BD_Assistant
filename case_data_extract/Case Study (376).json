They \nalso wanted to gauge the impact of their hiring plan on site-wise contribution margin.\n▪Merilytics partnered with the client to forecast the future profitability of each facility for various scenarios of headcount growth based on historical data\n▪Developed an automated model that uses the current month actuals and historical trends of employee headcount, payroll data, training ramp up \ninformation and employee productivity to predict major P&L line items like site contribution margin, revenue and costs for the coming three months\n▪Further broke down the change in employee headcount into changes in worked hours, scheduled/planned hours, billed hours, cancelled (patient therapy) \nhours and new employee training hours on a monthly basis, which resulted in granular visibility into headcount utilization and its impact on profitability\n▪Performed a sensitivity analysis to gauge the impact of various levels of hiring and attrition rate combinations on site contribution margin\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪Forecasting tool aided the management in making critical decisions regarding hiring trend and headcount growth of the organization\n▪Granular forecasts enabled the Management to identify the key sources of variances during their Monthly Operating Reviews\n▪The sensitivity analysis helped the client to understand the relationship between key growth drivers and P&L items such as costs, revenue and site \ncontribution\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a U.S.-based healthcare provider that offers Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy and related critical services to autistic children, adolescents, teens, and adults.\n1\n"
