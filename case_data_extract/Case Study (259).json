These opportunities had increased over time, due to ‘multiple sources’, ‘data loss during transfer from old DB’, ‘using different variants of \nnomenclature’ etc. \n▪\nMerilytics partnered with the client to clean up, update & streamline the existing database through a combination of manual search, automated offline \nscraping and de-duplication algorithms. \n▪\nMined external databases (such as Capital IQ etc.) to address mapping of industries/sectors and data completeness issues\n▪\nDeveloped an offline scraping bot to automate the search process and extract required information from the external databases\n▪\nBuilt Python based de-duplication algorithms to match the Positions/Titles with Company master database leading to reduction in redundancies and \nhigher accuracy of information\n▪\nUtilized the Python based algorithms to group Positions/Titles with similar company names and manually analyzed the groups to identify companies that \ncan be added to the database\n▪\nOnce the above companies are added, they can be mapped to the corresponding Positions/Titles\nVALUE ADDITION\n▪\nAchieved data completeness of ‘critical’ fields for ~98% of the companies in the company master database \n▪\nIncreased the number of correct Position-Company mapping by ~50%\n▪\nOffline scraping automation and de-duplication algorithms reduced manual efforts by 40%\n▪\nUpdated database improved the filtering capabilities of the tool (by Industry/Company) and helped the client in making better hiring decisions \n2\n"
