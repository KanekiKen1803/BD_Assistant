Due to its \nwidespread use as filler text for layouts, non-readability is of great importance\nSITUATION\n▪\nClient is one of the largest equipment rental companies in the U.S. who were evaluating a revamp of their pricing structure. \n▪\nExisting business practices did not have strict pricing guidelines, hence giving the flexibility to the sales force to define pricing terms based on \nindividual discretion, leading to excessive discounting and lower revenue yield.\n▪\nMerilytics partnered with the client and evaluated their pricing structure & salesforce performance to identify potential opportunities to \nimprove revenue yields.\n▪\nBased on the portfolio’s operational processes, transactions were segmented into clusters based on product types, lease duration, end customer \ntype, overall order size etc.\n▪\nFor similar clusters, we identified the average price for a particular product to be used as a benchmark to evaluate sales force performance\n▪\nDefined a metric ‘Mix Adjusted Yield Deficit (MAYD)’ to evaluate the sales force performance, which allows for normalization of the pricing for \nvarious factors that differ across transactions before comparing with benchmark pricing\n▪\nBased on the analysis, we helped the client identify weaker performers and estimate opportunity in addressing the anomalies\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪\nThrough an updated pricing structure, pricing guidelines and salesforce training, the client was able to increase the revenue yield by ~5 \npercentage points over a 03-year period while the top-line increased ~10% annually.\n2\n"
