To address this, you're seeking to streamline the invoicing process for these new customers and enhance leadership \nvisibility into ACV and open AR.\nB2B learning company needs a “clear view” into ACV & AR\n2\nYour value is enhanced. \nYou have given executive stakeholders precise insights into the ACV at the time of acquisition and identified 5% of the ACV as \ninvalid, allowing them to thoroughly analyze business performance by examining month-over-month ACV and AR bridge models. \nThis resulted in unlocking of potential ~$9M refund from the divesting company. You have also provided the finance team with \ncomprehensive visibility into the activity of acquired customers, identifying missed invoicing opportunities and enabling targeted \nanalysis and interventions to realize ~$ 10M revenue.\nACV & AR ANALYSIS\nKEY RESULT   \n•\nIdentification of \ninvalid ACV (5% of the \nacquired ACV) with a \npotential of ~$9 M \nrefund from divesting \ncompany\n•\nComprehensive \nvisibility into the \ncustomer activity \n(ACV, AR, invoices, \npayments, credit memo, \nusage, etc.)\n•\nUnlocked ~$ 10M missed \nrevenue opportunity\nVALUE LEVERS PULLED\n•\nCustomer mapping\n•\nACV analysis\n•\nACV & AR bridge model\n•\nInvoicing analysis\n•\nCustomer activity \nanalysis\n•\nCash reconciliation\n2\nYou turn to Accordion. \nWe partner with your team to thoroughly examine the invoicing processes, identify and highlight variances in datasets \n(transactions, subscriptions, usage, etc.) sourced from multiple platforms like Salesforce, NetSuite, Hyperion. Together, we \nfinalize a tailored approach for ACV and AR analyses for the acquired entities, including:\n1)\nDeveloping a master customer mapping for over 100k unique customers and source data to facilitate the analysis of \ndisparate datasets.\n2) Creating an ACV model to identify potential invalid ACV at the time of acquisition by analyzing subscriptions, payments, \ninvoices, and credit memos. This model tracks the ACV bridge to date, highlighting upsells, down sells, renewals, new \nbusiness, and win-backs at the individual customer level.\n3) Creating a month-over-month AR aging model categorized by time buckets (1-30 days, 31-60 days, etc.) for each \nindividual customer.\n4) Performing a comprehensive analysis of invoicing activities to aid in the cleanup of receivables, including identifying valid \nreceivables, those that need to be written off, and any missing receivables due to unbilled customers. This involves examining \nover 200 scenarios related to invoicing, subscriptions, and usage at the customer level.\n"
