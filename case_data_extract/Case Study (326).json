During the transition, there were issues \ndue to incorrect data migration, leading to misdirected orders thereby losing revenue in returns and exchanges, and impacting customer satisfaction\n•\nPartnered with the client to ensure one-time data migration and ongoing data synchronization, for order and customer data, across the two systems. In \naddition, we automated the data accuracy validation across both systems on daily basis.\nM2M to Magento data migration and validation for PE-owned \nmedical manufacturing firm\n2\nImpact\n•\nAchieved 99% accuracy of the data between the systems, after two iterations of data migration\n•\nProduct returns and exchanges reduced significantly (decrease in returns by ~15%)\n•\nSales team spent less time in processing orders and were able to handle more leads per day, leading to increase in revenue\nORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \nMIGRATION\n"
