So, they \nwanted to identify the quantum of these fraudulent work orders and the associated commission total amount paid to the vendor.\n▪\nMerilytics partnered with the client to identify the fraudulent work orders and associated commissions which will be used as evidence to summarize \nthe fraud issue to the Auditors and get the fraudulent commission paid reverted back from the vendors.\n▪\nFinalized the methodology for identifying fraudulent work orders (WO) based on the TAT for the WO (same day closure) and the time duration gap \nbetween the previous WO \n▪\nCombined data from multiple data sources including Work orders, Commissions, Technician details, sub-contractor, Insurance plans, WO location and \nbuilt a data model for Power BI dashboard.\n▪\nBuilt a dashboard providing visibility into the # fraudulent WOs and commissions paid along with the functionality to adjust the criteria for fraudulent \nwork orders if required. Also, allowing the users to deep dive into these work orders based on technician, location, sub-contractor etc.\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪\nIdentified evidence of fraudulent work orders allowing the client to charge back ~12M USD to the vendor \n▪\nProvided visibility into ~40K fraudulent work orders allowing the client to act on specific technician, location or sub-contractor related to WOs. The \ndashboard also provided insights into the process gaps behind these fraudulent WOs, thus helping the client avoid similar frauds in future.  \nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a multichannel video programming distributor in the U.S with 15M+ subscriber base\n1\n"
