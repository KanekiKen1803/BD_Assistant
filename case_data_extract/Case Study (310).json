This resulted in an increase in manpower in non-core activities and remediation cases. \n▪\nMerilytics partnered with the client and deployed NLP and speech recognition solutions to reduce underwriting errors, track real-time compliance \nand perform root cause analysis of call complaints\n▪\nAccurate Underwriting & Contracting: Created NLP based solution that evaluates the accuracy of a legal document against statutory requirements \nand financial product terms and highlights any infractions using advanced text mining algorithms\n▪\nLeveraged OCR and Encoding pattern recognition ML algorithms (such as Textract and Tika) to convert documents & images to hierarchical list of \nelements and validated the same for discrepancies and summarized the insights, real-time on a Tableau dashboard\n▪\nCall Quality Assurance: Used NLP tools to automate speech recognition of call center activity to automatically transcribe the conversations for \nanalytics. Evaluated compliance against mandatory disclosures and UDAAP (prevention of Unfair, Deceptive, Abusive Acts and Practices) compliance\n▪\nCall activity root-cause Analysis: Utilized classification and clustering algorithms on call transcripts to identify common issues raised by customers \nduring their customer service calls\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪\nReduced legal risk from underwriting errors, violation of state requirements and UDAAP rules\n▪\nAutomated contract review process that resulted in increased bandwidth for the compliance team to focus on other strategic initiatives\n▪\nStreamlined call center workflow, established standard operating procedures to improve adherence to best practices\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a financial services company that provides point-of-sale financing to consumers making purchases at stores across the U.S.\n2\n"
