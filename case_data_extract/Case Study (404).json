Currently, the AR assessment model is being updated \nmanually which has high response time to perform the A/R assessments in sales pipeline losing out on potential opportunities.\nRevenue cycle management service provider needs AR \nassessment / modelling\n2\nYour value is enhanced. \nYou have automated AR assessment solution, that enables you to increase the monthly run rate of doing pre-sales AR assessment \nby 50% that further increases the revenue, by onboarding more customers. You have reduced the FTE hours/week (by ~40%) \nrequired to perform the AR assessments and thereby decreasing the turn around time (TAT)  to provide initial AR assessment to \nthe service providers in sales pipelines. This model ensured that the output delivered, such as Net Collection Rate, Expected \nRevenue, Payments Received and AR Aging Status, is error-free and has flexibility to view the current RCM performance in \ncomparison with HFMA (Healthcare Financial Management Association) standards.\nAR ASSESSMENT / MODELLING \nKEY RESULT   \n•\n~40 FTE hours/week \nsaved\n•\nIncreased speed of \npre-sales assessment \nby 50%\nVALUE LEVERS PULLED\n•\nAR assessment model\n•\nPower BI dashboard\n2\nYou turn to Accordion. \nWe partner with your team to build AR assessment models for various SNF and health care providers and provide a comparative \nanalysis with the benchmark numbers, including: \n1)\nAnalyzing the AR assessment models (for Point Click Care and MatrixCare data systems) to develop an understanding of the \nkey KPI’s being used (such as Net Collection Rate, AR days, % AR over 90, etc.) and the methodology adopted for performing \nAR assessments\n2) Automating the data flow from the raw data files to the final output view, streamlining the dashboard for the Excel-based \nreporting view and subsequently working on transitioning the Excel-based model to the Power BI tool to provide real time \ninsights on AR assessments for customers in sales pipelines\n"
