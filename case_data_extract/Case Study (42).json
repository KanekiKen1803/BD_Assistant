Benchmarking data was reloaded into the database for further processing and sharing with third-party aggregator\n•\nDeveloped key metrics covered i.e., revenue, length of stay, occupancy for current  and future bookings and competitor occupancy, and deployed through \nPower BI reports, for easier tracking and monitoring\nSituation\n•\nClient’s POS systems were not integrated and generating daily operational reports was time consuming. Reports were developed on Excel and distributed \non email leading to overhead.\n•\nMerilytics partnered with the client to build a cloud-based pipeline to facilitate data integration and reporting\nData Integration and Reporting for a Hospitality Company\n2\nImpact\n•\nRemoved the manual step of sharing and receiving benchmarking data by automating the process end-to-end\n•\nAuto refresh Power BI dashboards eliminated the need to export reports from POS portals and manually copy data daily across Excel files for building reports\n•\nProvided insightful reports by combining data from the POS systems with competition data and providing trends across time\nData Integration and Reporting\n"
