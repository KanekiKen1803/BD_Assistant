Calculated a \ncustom percentile for each volatility bucket across \neach day of the week based on the allowed over-\nforecast limit for the bucket. Captured the \nseasonality (weekly, yearly) of demand in each \nlane and arrived at the baseline demand for each \nlane-day.\n▪Built a time-series model to forecast the minimum \nbaseline demand for each lane based on the \nhistorical dispatch volumes.\n▪Integrated the option to view grouped or individual \nlanes based on a destination grouping provided by \nthe client. This yielded improved forecasts for \ngrouped lanes where individual lanes did not have \nsufficient dispatch activity for reliable planning.\n▪Developed and delivered a dispatch planning \nmodel using the time series forecast when the \nvolatility method predicted zero demand\nPROCESSING\n▪The dispatch planning tool enabled the client to \nidentify and plan for the baseline demand across \nlanes, at a potentially lower cost.\n▪The tool covers ~55% of the total dispatch volume \nand could potentially reduce their shipping costs by \nup to ~10%, in addition to the planning man-hours \nsaved.\n▪The client’s execution team could focus their efforts \non the procurement of additional transportation \nassets required for the day in lanes with higher \nvariability.\n▪The client was also able to identify terminals with \nsub-optimal performance in dispatch KPIs and take \nmeasures to improve operational efficiencies and \noptimize costs.\nOUTPUTS\nABOUT THE CLIENT: Client is a US based transportation and logistics solutions provider operating primarily in less-than-truckload (LTL) services.\n"
