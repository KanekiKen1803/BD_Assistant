There was a significant revenue leakage due to these clinical denials with very low recovery rate.\n▪\nMerilytics partnered with the client in creating a robust denials reporting suite for their RCM (Revenue Cycle Management) team to track all clinical denial \nmetrics, analyze denial root causes, prioritize high amount denials and streamline appeals process..\n▪\nIntegrated data from different sources (Clinical Denials logged data, Billing data, Cash Collections data, Claim Appeals data, AR (Accounts Receivable) data) in \nto single consolidated dataset\n▪\nBuilt a comprehensive weekly report that tracks various denial metrics such as denied days, % denied days, denied amount, appeal cycle time, appeal \noutcome, collections on denials etc. by region, facility, insurance type, insurance plan etc.\n▪\nDeveloped a weekly RCA report, by mapping denials to their root causes, to identify top denial reasons by facility and insurance payer\n▪\nAssessed performance of RCM collectors specialized in clinical denials on how effectively they are following-up with insurance payers and submitting appeals \non clinical denials on-time\n▪\nBuilt executive monthly decks for each region to help RCM team heads to review the performance on clinical denials, compare with set target monthly goals \nfor each region and identify areas of opportunities to reduce their clinical denial rate.\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪\nThe comprehensive reporting suite helped client’s RCM team to take actions on clinical denials and prevent potential denials upfront. This had a direct impact \non their clinical denials and the denial rate came down from ~6% (in the quarter before the reporting) to ~4% (in the quarter after the reporting), which \ntranslates to a prevention of ~$7M/quarter in potential denial amount\n▪\nTime taken to log clinical denials into the system went down from ~13 days to ~6.5 days; and time taken to appeal the denials also went down from ~70 \ndays to ~50 days (before vs. after reporting)\n▪\nDue to the timely actions taken by client’s RCM team based on the reporting, the collections on denials increased by ~25%\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is Long Term Acute Care(LTAC) healthcare provider and has facilities in over 80 cities across the U.S.\n2\n"
