Data scaling & \n    feature selection\nAs the range of values varies across columns, data scaling was done to eliminate the variation before fitting it to the Clustering Model. \nMultiple techniques were used feature selection: \n▪Based on the business context, few variables were selected to explain the visiting and purchasing patterns of the customers\n▪Top 5-10 variables that affect the loyalty (from transaction date) and the purchase intent (from survey data) of the customers were \nidentified through random forest importance \n4. Clustering algorithm\nFive different clustering algorithms were tested (k-prototype, gaussian mixture model (GMM), agglomerative clustering, etc.) and the \nresults were evaluated to identify the best fit\n5. Post cluster analysis\nStatistical indexes (silhouette score and BIC score), industry accepted standards for cluster analysis (minimum and maximum size of the cluster), along with a \ncomprehensive cluster analysis (that evaluates the behavior of individual clusters and identifies the differentiating attributes between clusters) have been \nperformed to evaluate the sanity of the clusters\nApproach & methodology for project delivery\n4\n"
