Currently, there is no \nmature forecasting process, resulting in relatively low forecast accuracy, which causes production planning issues. \nAdditionally, sales, promotion, and stock-out data are not properly tracked, posing challenges for future growth planning.\nDairy product manufacturing company needs demand \nforecasting and operations planning\n2\nYour value is enhanced. \nYou have Accurate demand forecasts helped reduce raw material wastage during manufacturing process by 90%. Given the \nrelatively low shelf life of the raw materials (2-5 days), this led to 5 pps increase in the overall margins. You have improved \ndemand planning process, and the models helped the company improve their production planning and service levels\nDEMAND FORECASTING AND \nOPERATIONS PLANNING\nKEY RESULT   \n•\n90% reduced raw \nmaterial wastage\n•\n5 pps increase in \noverall margins\nVALUE LEVERS PULLED\n•\nDemand forecasting and \noperations planning\n2\nYou turn to Accordion. \nWe partner with your team to generate an integrated demand forecast at retailer level based on historical data normalized \nfor promotions, distribution, stock-outs and non-recurring events, and adjustments for future promotions & distribution \nchanges, including:\n1) Forecasting for top-retailers using statistical tools based on historical data normalized for promotions, distribution, \nstock-outs and non-recurring events; Adjusting the forecast for future promotions & distribution changes\n2) Generating 100% consolidated forecast which includes forecast for tail of retailers\n3) Creating a model to overlay various corporate adjustments at a customer and category level on the consolidated \nforecast\n4) Developing a model to generate the wholesale shipment schedule for the operations planning team based on the \nforecast after overlays\n"
