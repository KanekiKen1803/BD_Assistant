Currently, you are encountering significant challenges with its \ncurrent Data Architecture and Design for storage and data analysis. It employs a complex concepts, hampers the accurate tracking \nand logging of changes in subscriber records. These issues not only impact the effectiveness of analytics and reporting but also \nimpedes the ability to monitor critical customer journey aspects such as application dropouts and customer drop points in \nsubscriptions.\nHome security company needs redesigning subscriber \nanalytics \n2\nYour value is enhanced. \nYou were able to make data-driven decisions based on accurate and up-to-date information, improving strategic planning and \noperational efficiency with incorporating additional ~30% metrics. By accurately tracking customer journeys, application dropouts, \nand subscription drop points, addressed issues proactively, leading to improved customer satisfaction. Standardized processes and \ncomprehensive documentation enabled client to adapt quickly to future changes and requirements. This agility helped the company \nrespond to plan changes and monitoring requests more effectively, reducing response times by ~20% in near term.
