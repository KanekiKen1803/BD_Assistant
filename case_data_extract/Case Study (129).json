They also wanted to gauge the impact of their hiring plan on site-wise contribution margin.\n▪\nMerilytics was brought on board to forecast the future profitability of each facility for various scenarios of headcount growth based on \nhistorical data.\n▪\nDeveloped an automated model that uses the current month actuals and historical trends of employee headcount, payroll data, training ramp \nup information and employee productivity to predict major P&L line items like site contribution margin, revenue and costs for the coming \nthree months.\n▪\nFurther broke down the change in employee headcount into changes in worked hours, scheduled/planned hours, billed hours, cancelled \n(patient therapy) hours and new employee training hours on a monthly basis, which resulted in granular visibility into headcount utilization \nand its impact on profitability.\n▪\nPerformed a sensitivity analysis to gauge the impact of various levels of hiring and attrition rate combinations on site contribution margin.\nVALUE ADDITION\nIMPACT\n▪\nThe forecasting tool aided the management in making critical decisions regarding hiring trend and headcount growth of the organization.\n▪\nGranular forecasts enabled the Management to identify the key sources of variances during their Monthly Operating Reviews.\n▪\nThe sensitivity analysis helped the client to understand the relationship between key growth drivers and P&L items such as costs, revenue \nand site contribution.\nABOUT THE CLIENT\nClient is a US based healthcare firm which provides behavioral therapy to children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n2\n"
