Client didn’t have direct visibility into \nthe collection performance (turn-around of collection, status of follow-ups etc.) of the teams responsible for collections (internal RCM collection team, \nRCM collection vendors)\n▪Merilytics partnered with the client to build a comprehensive collection effort and efficiency reporting suite\n▪Integrated the Balance, Collections, Vendor Placement and Collectors follow-up data and performed data cleanup & formatting for analysis and reporting\n▪Designed an exhaustive list of metrics (collections, collection rate, return rate, recovery rate, time for first pay, write-offs etc.) to track the performance of \n3rd party collection vendors in a monthly refreshable vendor scorecard report, and take necessary actions to accelerate the collections\n▪Automated the vendor invoice reconciliation (comparing vendor invoice claims with client collection data) to highlight any discrepancy in invoice from the \nvendor\n▪Devised a logic to track the performance of the internal RCM team based on efforts spent in collection (calls performed vs. assigned) and efficiency of \nfollow-ups (balance collected) and created a monthly refreshable report to provide collector level visibility\n▪Client leveraged the vendor scorecard to re-negotiate the terms of contracts with each vendor and added a new vendor to enhance the collection \nperformance. Overall collection from vendors increased by ~$7.5M in 6 months after the report was published\n▪Identified ~$5M/year of overclaimed collection from vendor invoice reconciliation, leading to savings of ~$800K/year in commissions\n▪Based on the report to track the inhouse RCM team performance, the client was able to identify top accounts which need action from the team based on \npending AR\n"
